We used a Sec63p-green fluorescent protein fusion protein to study motility events associated with inheritance of cortical ER and nuclear ER in living yeast cells. During M phase before nuclear migration, we observed thick, apparently rigid tubular extensions emanating from the nuclear ER that elongate, undergo sweeping motions along the cell cortex, and shorten. Two findings support a role for microtubules in this process. First, extension of tubular structures from the nuclear ER is inhibited by destabilization of microtubules. Second, astral microtubules, structures that undergo similar patterns of extension, cortical surveillance and retraction, colocalize with nuclear ER extensions. During S and G(2) phases of the cell cycle, we observed anchorage of the cortical ER at the site of bud emergence and apical bud growth. Thin tubules of the ER that extend from the anchored cortical ER display undulating, apparently random movement and move into the bud as it grows. Finally, we found that cortical ER morphology is sensitive to a filamentous actin-destabilizing drug, latrunculin-A, and to mutations in the actin-encoding ACT1 gene. Our observations support 1) different mechanisms and cytoskeletal mediators for the inheritance of nuclear and cortical ER elements and 2) a mechanism for cortical ER inheritance that is cytoskeleton dependent but relies on anchorage, not directed movement.",PMID: 11907267 [PubMed - in process]

The SH3 domain of Myo5p regulates the polymerization of actin through interactions with both Las17p, a homolog of mammalian Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP), and Vrp1p, a homolog of WASP-interacting protein (WIP). Vrp1p is required for both the localization of Myo5p to cortical patch-like structures and the ATP-independent interaction between the Myo5p tail region and actin filaments. We have identified and characterized a new adaptor protein, Mti1p (Myosin tail region-interacting protein), which interacts with the SH3 domains of Myo3/5p. Mti1p co-immunoprecipitated with Myo5p and Mti1p-GFP co-localized with cortical actin patches. A null mutation of MTI1 exhibited synthetic lethal phenotypes with mutations in SAC6 and SLA2, which encode actin-bundling and cortical actin-binding proteins, respectively. Although the mti1 null mutation alone did not display any obvious phenotype, it suppressed vrp1 mutation phenotypes, including temperature-sensitive growth, abnormally large cell morphology, defects in endocytosis and salt-sensitive growth. These results suggest that Mti1p and Vrp1p antagonistically regulate type I myosin functions.",PMID: 11901111 [PubMed - in process]

The inhibitor is present in the active site, principally as divanadate, but with evidence of additional vanadate moieties at either end, and representing a different binding mode to that observed in the structural homologue prostatic acid phosphatase. The analysis reveals the enzyme-ligand interactions involved in inhibition of the mutase activity by vanadate and identifies a water molecule, observed in the native E.coli dPGM structure which, once activated by vanadate, may dephosphorylate the active protein. Rather than reflecting the active conformation previously observed for E.coli dPGM, the inhibited protein's conformation resembles that of the inactive dephosphorylated Saccharomyces cerevisiae dPGM. The provision of a high-resolution structure of both active and inactive forms of dPGM from a single organism, in conjunction with computational modelling of substrate molecules in the active site provides insight into the binding of substrates and the specific interactions necessary for three different activities, mutase, synthase and phosphatase, within a single active site. The sequence similarity of E.coli and human dPGMs allows us to correlate stucture with clinical pathology. Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.",PMID: 11884145 [PubMed - in process]

One of the subunits of the APC that is required for its ubiquitination activity is Doc1/Apc10, a protein composed of a Doc1 homology domain that has been identified in a number of diverse putative E3 ubiquitin ligases. Here, we present the crystal structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Doc1/Apc10 at 2.2A resolution. The Doc1 homology domain forms a beta-sandwich structure that is related in architecture to the galactose-binding domain of galactose oxidase, the coagulation factor C2 domain and a domain of XRCC1. Residues that are invariant amongst Doc1/Apc10 sequences, including a temperature-sensitive mitotic arrest mutant, map to a beta-sheet region of the molecule, whose counterpart in galactose oxidase, the coagulation factor C2 domains and XRCC1, mediate bio-molecular interactions. This finding suggests the identification of the functionally important and conserved region of Doc1/Apc10 and, since invariant residues of Doc1/Apc10 colocalise with conserved residues of other Doc1 homology domains, we propose that the Doc1 homology domains perform common ubiquitination functions in the APC and other E3 ubiquitin ligases.

Although RNase P from all kingdoms of life have been found to have essential RNA subunits, the number and size of the protein subunits ranges from one small protein in bacteria to at least nine proteins of up to 100 kDa. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear RNase P, the enzyme is composed of ten subunits: a single RNA and nine essential proteins. The spatial organization of these components within the enzyme is not yet understood. In this study we examine the likely binary protein--protein and protein--RNA subunit interactions by using directed two- and three-hybrid tests in yeast. Only two protein subunits, Pop1p and Pop4p, specifically bind the RNA subunit. Pop4p also interacted with seven of the other eight protein subunits. The remaining protein subunits all showed one or more specific protein--protein interactions with the other integral protein subunits. Of particular interest was the behavior of Rpr2p, the only protein subunit found in RNase P but not in the closely related enzyme, RNase MRP. Rpr2p interacts strongly with itself as well as with Pop4p. Similar interactions with self and Pop4p were also detected for Snm1p, the only unique protein subunit so far identified in RNase MRP. This observation is consistent with Snm1p and Rpr2p serving analogous functions in the two enzymes.

SWI/SNF function in this regard requires the presence of an activator with which it can interact directly, linking activator recruitment of SWI/SNF to transcriptional stimulation. In this study, we determine the SWI/SNF subunits that mediate its interaction with activators. Using a photo-cross-linking label transfer strategy, we show that the Snf5, Swi1, and Swi2/Snf2 subunits are contacted by the yeast acidic activators, Gcn4 and Hap4, in the context of the intact native SWI/SNF complex. In addition, we show that the same three subunits can interact individually with acidic activation domains, indicating that each subunit contributes to binding activators. Furthermore, mutations that reduce the activation potential of these activators also diminish its interaction with each of these SWI/SNF subunits. Thus, three distinct subunits of the SWI/SNF complex contribute to its interactions with activation domains.",PMID: 11865042 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

Previous combinatorial library screening has shown that FHA1 strongly selects peptides containing a pTXXD motif. Subsequent location of this motif within the sequence of Rad9, the target protein, coupled with spectroscopic analysis has led to identification of a tight binding sequence that is likely the binding site of FHA1: (188)SLEV(pT)EADATFVQ(200). We present solution structures of FHA1 in complex with this pT-peptide and with another Rad9-derived pT-peptide that has ca 30-fold lower affinity, (148)KKMTFQ(pT)PTDPLE(160). Both complexes showed intermolecular NOEs predominantly between three peptide residues (pT, +1, and +2 residues) and five FHA1 residues (S82, R83, S85, T106, and N107). Furthermore, the following interactions were implicated on the basis of chemical shift perturbations and structural analysis: the phosphate group of the pT residue with the side-chain amide group of N86 and the guanidino group of R70, and the carboxylate group of Asp (at the +3 position) with the guanidino group of R83. The generated structures revealed a similar binding mode adopted by these two peptides, suggesting that pT and the +3 residue Asp are the major contributors to binding affinity and specificity, while +1 and +2 residues could provide additional fine-tuning. It was also shown that FHA1 does not bind to the corresponding pS-peptides or a related pY-peptide. We suggest that differentiation between pT and pS-peptides by FHA1 can be attributed to hydrophobic interactions between the methyl group of the pT residue and the aliphatic protons of R83, S85, and T106 from FHA1.

The complex consists of at least eight protein components, but is not tightly associated with spliceosomal snRNAs. By a combination of genetic and biochemical methods we previously identified four components of this complex, Ntc25p, Ntc85p, Ntc30p and Ntc20p, all of them being novel splicing factors. We have now identified three other components of the complex, Ntc90p, Ntc77p and Ntc31p. These three proteins were also associated with the spliceosome during the splicing reaction in the same manner as Prp19p, concurrently with or immediately after dissociation of U4 snRNA. Two-hybrid analysis revealed that none of these proteins interacted with Prp19p or Ntc25p, but all interacted with Ntc85p. An interaction network between the identified components of the Prp19p-associated complex is demonstrated. Biochemical analysis revealed that Ntc90p, Ntc31p, Ntc30p and Ntc20p form a subcomplex, which, through interacting with Ntc85p and Ntc77p, can associate with Prp19p and Ntc25p to form the Prp19p-associated complex. Genetic analysis suggests that Ntc31p, Ntc30p and Ntc20p may play roles in modulating the function of Ntc90p.",PMID: 11842115 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

To identify potential regulatory or targeting subunits of yeast PP1(C), we tagged Glc7p at its amino terminus with protein A and affinity-purified Glc7p protein complexes from yeast. The purified proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and identified by peptide mass fingerprint analysis using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. To confirm the accuracy of our identifications, peptides from some of the proteins were also sequenced using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Only four of the Glc7p-associated proteins that we identified (Mhp1p, Bni4p, Ref2p, and Sds22p) have previously been shown to interact with Glc7p, and multiple components of the CPF (cleavage and polyadenylation factor) complex involved in messenger RNA 3'-end processing were present as major components in the Glc7p-associated protein fraction. To confirm the interaction of Glc7p with this complex, we used the same approach to purify and characterize the components of the yeast CPF complex using protein A-tagged Pta1p. Six known components of the yeast (CPF) complex, together with Glc7p, were identified among the Pta1p-associated polypeptides using peptide mass fingerprint analysis. Thus Glc7p is a novel component of the CPF complex and may therefore be involved regulating mRNA 3'-end processing.",PMID: 11841235 [PubMed - in process]

Here we present a strategy to probe conformational changes of proteins inside cells. Our method involves: (i) engineering binding proteins to different conformations of a target protein, and (ii) using them to sense changes in the surface property of the target in cells. We probed ligand-induced conformational changes of the estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) ligand-binding domain (LBD). By using yeast two-hybrid techniques, we first performed combinatorial library screening of ""monobodies"" (small antibody mimics using the scaffold of a fibronectin type III domain) for clones that bind to ER alpha and then characterized their interactions with ER alpha in the nucleus, the native environment of ER alpha, in the presence of various ligands. A library using a highly flexible loop yielded monobodies that specifically recognize a particular ligand complex of ER alpha, and the pattern of monobody specificity was consistent with the structural differences found in known crystal structures of ER alpha-LBD. A more restrained loop library yielded clones that bind both agonist- and antagonist-bound ER alpha. Furthermore, we found that a deletion of the ER alpha F domain that is C-terminally adjacent to the LBD increased the crossreactivity of monobodies to the apo-ER alpha-LBD, suggesting a dynamic nature of the ER alpha-LBD conformation and a role of the F domain in restraining the LBD in an inactive conformation.",PMID: 11818562 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

By mammalian two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays, we show that the hCsl4p protein interacts directly with two other exosome proteins, hRrp42p and hRrp46p. Mutants of hCsl4p that fail to interact with either hRrp42p or hRrp46p are also not able to associate with exosome complexes in vivo.

With the advent of ultrasensitive mass spectrometric protein identification methods, it is feasible to identify directly protein complexes on a proteome-wide scale. Here we report, using the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a test case, an example of this approach, which we term high-throughput mass spectrometric protein complex identification (HMS-PCI). Beginning with 10% of predicted yeast proteins as baits, we detected 3,617 associated proteins covering 25% of the yeast proteome. Numerous protein complexes were identified, including many new interactions in various signalling pathways and in the DNA damage response. Comparison of the HMS-PCI data set with interactions reported in the literature revealed an average threefold higher success rate in detection of known complexes compared with large-scale two-hybrid studies. Given the high degree of connectivity observed in this study, even partial HMS-PCI coverage of complex proteomes, including that of humans, should allow comprehensive identification of cellular networks."

"Peptide recognition modules mediate many protein-protein interactions critical for the assembly of macromolecular complexes. Complete genome sequences have revealed thousands of these domains, requiring improved methods for identifying their physiologically relevant binding partners. We have developed a strategy combining computational prediction of interactions from phage-display ligand consensus sequences with large-scale two-hybrid physical interaction tests. Application to yeast SH3 domains generated a phage-display network containing 394 interactions among 206 proteins and a two-hybrid network containing 233 interactions among 145 proteins. Graph theoretic analysis identified 59 highly likely interactions common to both networks.

"The 26S proteasome plays a major role in eukaryotic protein breakdown, especially for ubiquitin-tagged proteins. Substrate specificity is conferred by the regulatory particle (RP), which can dissociate into stable lid and base subcomplexes. To help define the molecular organization of the RP, we tested all possible paired interactions among subunits from Saccharomyces cerevisiae by yeast two-hybrid analysis. Within the base, a Rpt4/5/3/6 interaction cluster was evident. Within the lid, a structural cluster formed around Rpn5/11/9/8. Interactions were detected among synonymous subunits (Csn4/5/7/6) from the evolutionarily related COP9 signalosome (CSN) from Arabidopsis, implying a similar quaternary arrangement. No paired interactions were detected between lid, base or core particle subcomplexes, suggesting that stable contacts between them require prior assembly.

"The major pathway of eukaryotic mRNA decay involves deadenylation-dependent decapping followed by 5' to 3' exonucleolytic degradation. By examining interactions among mRNA decay factors, the mRNA, and key translation factors, we have identified a critical transition in mRNP organization that leads to decapping and degradation of yeast mRNAs. This transition occurs after deadenylation and includes loss of Pab1p, eIF4E, and eIF4G from the mRNA and association of the decapping activator complex, Lsm1p-7p, which enhances the coimmunoprecipitation of a decapping enzyme complex (Dcp1p and Dcp2p) with the mRNA. These results define an important rearrangement in mRNP organization and suggest that deadenylation promotes mRNA decapping by both the loss of Pab1p and the recruitment of the Lsm1p-7p complex.",PMID: 11741542 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,36: Genome Res  2001 Dec;11(12):1971-3 ,Is there a bias in proteome research?
"Advances in technology have enabled us to take a fresh look at data acquired by traditional single experiments and to compare them with genomewide data. The differences can be tremendous, as we show here, in the field of proteomics. We have compared data sets of protein-protein interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that were detected by an identical underlying technical method, the yeast two-hybrid system. We found that the individually identified protein-protein interactions are considerably different from those identified by two genomewide scans. Interacting proteins in the pooled database from single publications are much more closely related to each other with respect to transcription profiles when compared to genomewide data. This difference may have been introduced by two factors: by a selection process in individual publications and by false positives in the whole-genome scans. If we assume that the differences are a result of false positives in the whole-genome data, the scans would contain 47%, 44%, and 91% of false positives for the UETZ, ITO-core, and ITO-full data, respectively. If, however, the true fraction of false positives is considerably lower than estimated here, the data from hypothesis-driven experiments must have been subjected to a serious selection process.",PMID: 11731485 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,"37: Microbiol Mol Biol Rev  2001 Dec;65(4):570-94, table of contents ",Transport into and out of the nucleus.
"A defining characteristic of eukaryotic cells is the possession of a nuclear envelope. Transport of macromolecules between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments occurs through nuclear pore complexes that span the double membrane of this envelope. The molecular basis for transport has been revealed only within the last few years. The transport mechanism lacks motors and pumps and instead operates by a process of facilitated diffusion of soluble carrier proteins, in which vectoriality is provided by compartment-specific assembly and disassembly of cargo-carrier complexes. The carriers recognize localization signals on the cargo and can bind to pore proteins. They also bind a small GTPase, Ran, whose GTP-bound form is predominantly nuclear. Ran-GTP dissociates import carriers from their cargo and promotes the assembly of export carriers with cargo. The ongoing discovery of numerous carriers, Ran-independent transport mechanisms, and cofactors highlights the complexity of the nuclear transport process. Multiple regulatory mechanisms are also being identified that control cargo-carrier interactions. Circadian rhythms, cell cycle, transcription, RNA processing, and signal transduction are all regulated at the level of nucleocytoplasmic transport. This review focuses on recent discoveries in the field, with an emphasis on the carriers and cofactors involved in transport and on possible mechanisms for movement through the nuclear pores.","Publication Types: Review Review, Academic",PMID: 11729264 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,38: Genetics  2001 Nov;159(3):1291-8

We also find that Rad50 is not required for slowing down S phase in response to hydroxy urea or methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) treatment. Interestingly, in rad50Delta cells, the recombination frequency between two homologous chromosomes is increased at the expense of sister chromatid recombination. We propose that Rad50, an SMC-like protein, promotes the use of the sister chromatid as the template for homologous recombinational repair. In support of this, we found that Rad50 functions in the same pathway for the repair of MMS-induced damage as Rad21, the homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Scc1 cohesin protein.

Sli15 associates directly with the Ipl1 protein kinase and these two proteins colocalize to the mitotic spindle. We show here that Sli15 stimulates the in vitro, and likely in vivo, kinase activity of Ipl1, and Sli15 facilitates the association of Ipl1 with the mitotic spindle. The Ipl1-binding and -stimulating activities of Sli15 both reside within a region containing homology to the metazoan inner centromere protein (INCENP). Ipl1 and Sli15 also bind to Dam1, a microtubule-binding protein required for mitotic spindle integrity and kinetochore function. Sli15 and Dam1 are most likely physiological targets of Ipl1 since Ipl1 can phosphorylate both proteins efficiently in vitro, and the in vivo phosphorylation of both proteins is reduced in ipl1 mutants. Some dam1 mutations exacerbate the phenotype of ipl1 and sli15 mutants, thus providing evidence that Dam1 interactions with Ipl1-Sli15 are functionally important in vivo. Similar to Dam1, Ipl1 and Sli15 each bind to microtubules directly in vitro, and they are associated with yeast centromeric DNA in vivo.

TFIIB enters the preinitiation complex (PIC) primarily through contact with the TATA box binding protein (TBP), an interaction mediated by three TBP residues [12-14]. To study the role of TFIIB in transcription activation in vivo, we randomly mutagenized these three residues in yeast TBP and screened for promoter-specific activation mutants. One mutant bearing a single conservative substitution, TBP-E186D, is the focus of this study. As expected, TBP-E186D binds normally to the TATA box but fails to support the entry of TFIIB into the PIC. Cells expressing TBP-E186D are viable but have a severe slow-growth phenotype. Whole-genome expression analysis indicates that transcription of 17% of yeast genes are compromised by this mutation. Chimeric promoter analysis indicates that the region of the gene that confers sensitivity to the TBP-E186D mutation is the UAS (upstream activating sequence), which contains the activator binding sites. Most interestingly, other TBP mutants that interfere with different interactions (TFIIB, TFIIA, or the TATA box) and a TFIIB mutant defective for interaction with TBP all manifest distinct and selective promoter-specific activation defects.

The ATPase activities are weak, consistent with the hypothesis that ATP binding is primarily responsible for modulating interactions with other MMR components. Three approaches, ATP hydrolysis assays, limited proteolysis protection, and equilibrium dialysis, provide evidence that the amino-terminal domain of Mlh1 binds ATP with >10-fold higher affinity than does the amino-terminal domain of Pms1.

In yeast, the role of Cdc42 in polarization of cell growth includes polarization of the actin cytoskeleton, which delivers secretory vesicles to growth sites at the plasma membrane. We now describe a novel temperature-sensitive mutant, cdc42-6, that reveals a role for Cdc42 in docking and fusion of secretory vesicles that is independent of its role in actin polarization. cdc42-6 mutants can polarize actin and deliver secretory vesicles to the bud, but fail to fuse those vesicles with the plasma membrane. This defect is manifested only during the early stages of bud formation when growth is most highly polarized, and appears to reflect a requirement for Cdc42 to maintain maximally active exocytic machinery at sites of high vesicle throughput. Extensive genetic interactions between cdc42-6 and mutations in exocytic components support this hypothesis, and indicate a functional overlap with Rho3, which also regulates both actin organization and exocytosis. Localization data suggest that the defect in cdc42-6 cells is not at the level of the localization of the exocytic apparatus.

In the absence of nucleotide and salt, S1 bound to both wild-type and mutant actins with high affinity (K(d) < microM), but either ADP or increased ionic strength decreased this affinity. This decrease was more pronounced for actins with mutations that inhibit functional interaction with myosin (E99A/E100A and I341A) than for a mutation that enhances the interaction (4Ac). The mutations E99A/E100A and I341A affected the microsecond time scale dynamics of actin in the absence of myosin, but the 4Ac mutation did not have any effect. The binding of myosin eliminated these effects of mutations on structural dynamics; i.e., the spectroscopic signals from mutant actins bound to S1 were the same as those from wild-type actin.

We show here that the yeast microtubule-binding protein, Dam1p, associates physically and functionally with kinetochores, suggesting a role in kinetochore attachment to the spindle. An epitope-tagged version of Dam1p colocalizes with the integral kinetochore component Ndc10p/Cbf2p in immunofluorescence analysis of chromosome spreads. In addition, Dam1p is associated preferentially with centromeric DNA as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, and this association depends on Ndc10p/Cbf2p. We also demonstrate genetic interactions between DAM1 and CTF19 or SLK19 genes encoding kinetochore proteins. Although the defect caused by the dam1-1 mutation leads to activation of the spindle checkpoint surveillance system and consequent persistence of sister chromatid cohesion, the metaphase arrest spindle abnormally elongates, resulting in virtually complete chromosome missegregation. Execution point experiments indicate that Dam1p has a role in formation of a metaphase spindle and in anaphase spindle elongation. Finally, we have observed that the protein encoded by the dam1-1 allele becomes delocalized at the nonpermissive temperature, correlating with the subsequent onset of the mutant phenotype.

We identified two Prk1p phosphorylation sites within the Pan1p-binding protein Ent1p, a yeast epsin homologue, and demonstrate Prk1p-dependent phosphorylation of both threonines. Converting both threonines to either glutamate or alanine mimics constitutively phosphorylated or dephosphorylated Ent1p, respectively.

Sir3p and Sir4p are structural components of silent chromatin that can self-associate, interact with each other, and bind to the amino-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4. We have identified a small region of Sir3p between amino acids 455 and 481 that is necessary and sufficient for association with the carboxyl terminus of Rap1p but not required for Sir complex formation or histone binding. SIR3 mutations that delete this region cause a silencing defect at HMR and telomeres. However, this impairment of repression is considerably less than that displayed by Rap1p carboxy-terminal truncations that are defective in Sir3p binding. This difference may be explained by the ability of the Rap1p carboxyl terminus to interact independently with Sir4p, which we demonstrate by in vitro binding and two-hybrid assays. Significantly, the Rap1p-Sir4p two-hybrid interaction does not require Sir3p and is abolished by mutation of the carboxyl terminus of Rap1p. We propose that both Sir3p and Sir4p can directly and independently bind to Rap1p at mating type silencers and telomeres and suggest that Rap1p-mediated recruitment of Sir proteins operates through multiple cooperative interactions, at least some of which are redundant. The physical separation of the Rap1p interaction region of Sir3p from parts of the protein required for Sir complex formation and histone binding raises the possibility that Rap1p can participate directly in the maintenance of silent chromatin through the stabilization of Sir complex-nucleosome interactions.",PMID: 11689698 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,

However, the biochemical function of frataxin has remained obscure, hampering attempts at therapeutic intervention. To predict functional interactions of frataxin with other proteins we investigated whether its gene specifically co-occurs with any other genes in sequenced genomes. In 56 available genomes we identified two genes with identical phylogenetic distributions to the frataxin/cyaY gene: hscA and hscB/JAC1. These genes have not only emerged in the same evolutionary lineage as the frataxin gene, they have also been lost at least twice with it, and they have been horizontally transferred with it in the evolution of the mitochondria. The proteins encoded by hscA and hscB, the chaperone HSP66 and the co-chaperone HSP20, have been shown to be required for the synthesis of 2Fe-2S clusters on ferredoxin in proteobacteria. JAC1, an ortholog of hscB, and SSQ1, a paralog of hscA, have been shown to be required for iron-sulfur cluster assembly in mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Combining data on the co-occurrence of genes in genomes with experimental and predicted cellular localization data of their proteins supports the hypothesis that frataxin is directly involved in iron-sulfur cluster protein assembly. They indicate that frataxin is specifically involved in the same sub-process as HSP20/Jac1p.",PMID: 11689493 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,
"Identification of interaction partners for two closely-related members of the ETS protein family, FLI and ERG.","Deramaudt TB, Remy P, Stiegler P.","FRE 2168 du CNRS, Mecanismes Moleculaires de la Division Cellulaire et du Developpement, Institut de Physiologie et de Chimie Biologique, 21 rue Rene Descartes, 67084 Strasbourg Cedex, France.","Fli and erg are two members of the ETS gene family that encodes transcription factors related to the c-ets-1 proto-oncogene. The products of the ETS genes act as transcriptional effectors in cell proliferation, differentiation, and oncogenic transformation. FLI and ERG, two closely-related proteins, bind, as do all the ETS proteins characterized so far, to DNA sequences with an invariable central GGA core flanked by preferred nucleotides. Nevertheless, promoter-specific responses to FLI or ERG may be driven by mechanisms involving multicomponent complexes. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have identified several proteins that physically interact with either FLI or ERG proteins used as bait. The Xenopus developmentally implicated Xvent-2 and Xvent-2B proteins, and the Xenopus splicing factor RNP-C/U1C physically interact with Xl-FLI and Xl-ERG, both in the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro. We also report the potential interaction of FLI and ERG with Sox-D, a stabilizing protein that may modulate their transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the possible involvement of the transcriptional effectors FLI and ERG in mRNA processing, hematopoiesis or in the control of angiogenesis is suggested through possible interactions with, respectively, RNA binding proteins and hnRNPs, a repressor of the hematopoietic pathway (SAP18), and the HAF protein.",PMID: 11675009 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Thermodynamic linked-function analysis of Mg(2+)-activated yeast pyruvate kinase.,"Bollenbach TJ, Nowak T.","Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana 46556 USA.","Yeast pyruvate kinase (YPK) is regulated by intermediates of the glycolytic pathway [e.g., phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), and citrate] and by the ATP charge of the cell. Recent kinetic and thermodynamic data with Mn(2+)-activated YPK show that Mn(2+) mediates the allosteric communication between the substrate, PEP, and the allosteric effector, FBP [Mesecar, A., and Nowak, T. (1997) Biochemistry 36, 6792, 6803]. These results indicate that divalent cations modulate multiligand interactions, and hence cooperativity with YPK. The nature of multiligand interactions on YPK was investigated in the presence of the physiological divalent activator Mg(2+). The binding interactions of PEP, Mg(2+), and FBP were monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy. The binding data were subject to thermodynamic linked-function analysis to determine the magnitudes of the multiligand interactions governing the allosteric activation of YPK. The two ligand coupling free energies between PEP and Mg(2+), PEP and FBP, and FBP and Mg(2+) are 0.88, -0.38, and -0.75 kcal/mol, respectively. The two-ligand coupling free energies between PEP and Mn(2+) and FBP and Mn(2+) are more negative than those with Mg(2+) as the cation. This indicates that the interactions between the divalent cation and PEP with YPK are different for Mg(2+) and Mn(2+) and that the interaction is not simply electrostatic in nature, as originally hypothesized. The magnitude of the heterotropic interaction between the metal and FBP is similar with Mg(2+) and Mn(2+). The simultaneous binding of Mg(2+), PEP, and FBP to YPK is favored by 3.21 kcal/mol compared to independent binding. This complex is destabilized by 3.30 kcal/mol relative to the analogous YPK-Mn(2+)-PEP-FDP complex. Interpretation of K(d) values when cooperative binding occurs must be done with care as these are not simple thermodynamic constants. These data demonstrate that the divalent metal, which activates phosphoryl transfer in YPK, plays a key role in modulating the various multiligand interactions that define the overall allosteric properties of the enzyme.",PMID: 11669647 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

By a combination of two-hybrid and phage-display approaches, we have identified six new ligands of the Abp1-SH3 domain. None of these SH3-mediated novel interactions was detected in recent all genome high throughput protein interaction projects. Here we show that the SH3-mediated association of Abp1p with the Ser/Thr kinases Prk1p and Ark1p is essential for their localization to actin cortical patches. The Abp1-SH3 domain has a rather unusual binding specificity, because its target peptides contain the tetrapentapeptide +XXXPXXPX+PXXL with positive charges flanking the polyproline core on both sides. Here we present the structure of the Abp1-SH3 domain solved at 1.3-A resolution. The peptide-binding pockets in the SH3 domain are flanked by two acidic residues that are uncommon at those positions in the SH3 domain family.

These two mutant CuZnSOD proteins may be described as type 2 (or normal) rather than type 1 (or blue) copper-cysteinate proteins and are characterized by their yellow rather than blue color, resulting from intense copper-to-sulfur charge transfer bands around 400 nm, their type 2 EPR spectra, with large rather than small nuclear hyperfine interactions, and their characteristic type 2 d-d electronic absorption spectra.

Asymmetric recognition of DNA local distortion. Structure-based functional studies of eukaryotic Msh2-Msh6.,"Drotschmann K, Yang W, Brownewell FE, Kool ET, Kunkel TA.","Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, NIEHS, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709, USA.","Crystal structures of bacterial MutS homodimers bound to mismatched DNA reveal asymmetric interactions of the two subunits with DNA. A phenylalanine and glutamate of one subunit make mismatched base-specific interactions, and residues of both subunits contact the DNA backbone surrounding the mismatched base, but asymmetrically. A number of amino acids in MutS that contact the DNA are conserved in the eukaryotic Msh2-Msh6 heterodimer. We report here that yeast strains with amino acids substituted for residues inferred to interact with the DNA backbone or mismatched base have elevated spontaneous mutation rates consistent with defective mismatch repair. Purified Msh2-Msh6 with substitutions in the conserved Phe(337) and Glu(339) in Msh6 thought to stack or hydrogen bond, respectively, with the mismatched base do have reduced DNA binding affinity but normal ATPase activity. Moreover, wild-type Msh2-Msh6 binds with lower affinity to mismatches with thymine replaced by difluorotoluene, which lacks the ability to hydrogen bond. The results suggest that yeast Msh2-Msh6 interacts asymmetrically with the DNA through base-specific stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions and backbone contacts. The importance of these contacts decreases with increasing distance from the mismatch, implying that interactions at and near the mismatch are important for binding in a kinked DNA conformation.",PMID: 11641390 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Genetic interactions of Spt4-Spt5 and TFIIS with the RNA polymerase II CTD and CTD modifying enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"Lindstrom DL, Hartzog GA.","Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California, Santa Cruz, 95064, USA.","Genetic and biochemical studies have identified many factors thought to be important for transcription elongation. We investigated relationships between three classes of these factors: (1) transcription elongation factors Spt4-Spt5, TFIIS, and Spt16; (2) the C-terminal heptapeptide repeat domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II; and (3) protein kinases that phosphorylate the CTD and a phosphatase that dephosphorylates it. We observe that spt4 and spt5 mutations cause strong synthetic phenotypes in combination with mutations that shorten or alter the composition of the CTD; affect the Kin28, Bur1, or Ctk1 CTD kinases; and affect the CTD phosphatase Fcp1. We show that Spt5 co-immunoprecipitates with RNA polymerase II that has either a hyper- or a hypophosphorylated CTD. Furthermore, mutation of the CTD or of CTD modifying enzymes does not affect the ability of Spt5 to bind RNA polymerase II. We find a similar set of genetic interactions between the CTD, CTD modifying enzymes, and TFIIS. In contrast, an spt16 mutation did not show these interactions. These results suggest that the CTD plays a key role in modulating elongation in vivo and that at least a subset of elongation factors are dependent upon the CTD for their normal function.",PMID: 11606527 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

The presence of a conserved motif (Asp-X-Asp-X-Thr) in the N terminus of MDP-1 suggested a relationship to the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily, which contains a number of magnesium-dependent acid phosphatases. These phosphatases utilize an aspartate nucleophile and contain a number of conserved active-site residues and hydrophobic patches, which can be plausibly aligned with conserved residues in MDP-1. Seven site-specific point mutants of MDP-1 were produced by modifying the catalytic aspartate, serine, and lysine residues to asparagine or glutamate, alanine, and arginine, respectively. The activity of these mutants confirms the assignment of MDP-1 as a member of the HAD superfamily. Detailed comparison of the sequence of the 15 MDP-1 sequences from various organisms with other HAD superfamily sequences suggests that MDP-1 is not closely related to any particular member of the superfamily. The crystal structures of several HAD family enzymes identify a domain proximal to the active site responsible for important interactions with low molecular weight substrates. The absence of this domain or any other that might perform the same function in MDP-1 suggests an ""open"" active site capable of interactions with large substrates such as proteins. This suggestion was experimentally confirmed by demonstration that MDP-1 is competent to catalyze the dephosphorylation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins.",PMID: 11601995 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

Apocytochrome c defines one of several pathways known to reach the intermembrane space, yet the components and pathways involved in outer membrane translocation are poorly defined. Here, we report the reconstitution of the apocytochrome c import reaction using proteoliposomes harbouring purified components. Import specifically requires the protease-resistant part of the TOM complex and is driven by interactions of the apoprotein with internal parts of the complex (involving Tom40) and the 'trans-side receptor' cytochrome c haem lyase. Despite the necessity of TOM complex function, the translocation pathway of apocytochrome c does not overlap with that of presequence-containing preproteins. We conclude that the TOM complex is a universal preprotein translocase that mediates membrane passage of apocytochrome c and other preproteins along distinct pathways. Apocytochrome c may provide a paradigm for the import of other small proteins into the intermembrane space such as factors used in apoptosis and protection from stress.",PMID: 11598006 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

Cdc42 interacts with the exocyst and regulates polarized secretion.,"Zhang X, Bi E, Novick P, Du L, Kozminski KG, Lipschutz JH, Guo W.","Department of Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.","Polarized delivery and incorporation of proteins and lipids to specific domains of the plasma membrane is fundamental to a wide range of biological processes such as neuronal synaptogenesis and epithelial cell polarization.

Sec3p, a component of the exocyst, is thought to be a spatial landmark for polarized exocytosis. In a search for proteins that regulate the localization of the exocyst in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we found that certain cdc42 mutants affect the polarized localization of the exocyst proteins. In addition, we found that these mutant cells have a randomized protein secretion pattern on the cell surface. Biochemical experiments indicated that Sec3p directly interacts with Cdc42 in its GTP-bound form.

Structure of a conjugating enzyme-ubiquitin thiolester intermediate reveals a novel role for the ubiquitin tail.,"Hamilton KS, Ellison MJ, Barber KR, Williams RS, Huzil JT, McKenna S, Ptak C, Glover M, Shaw GS.","Department of Biochemistry, The University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta T6G 2H7, Canada.","BACKGROUND: Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) are central enzymes involved in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. During this process, ubiquitin (Ub) and the E2 protein form an unstable E2-Ub thiolester intermediate prior to the transfer of ubiquitin to an E3-ligase protein and the labeling of a substrate for degradation. A series of complex interactions occur among the target substrate, ubiquitin, E2, and E3 in order to efficiently facilitate the transfer of the ubiquitin molecule. However, due to the inherent instability of the E2-Ub thiolester, the structural details of this complex intermediate are not known. RESULTS: A three-dimensional model of the E2-Ub thiolester intermediate has been determined for the catalytic domain of the E2 protein Ubc1 (Ubc1(Delta450)) and ubiquitin from S. cerevisiae. The interface of the E2-Ub intermediate was determined by kinetically monitoring thiolester formation by 1H-(15)N HSQC spectra by using combinations of 15N-labeled and unlabeled Ubc1(Delta450) and Ub proteins. By using the surface interface as a guide and the X-ray structures of Ub and the 1.9 A structure of Ubc1(Delta450) determined here, docking simulations followed by energy minimization were used to produce the first model of a E2-Ub thiolester intermediate. CONCLUSIONS: Complementary surfaces were found on the E2 and Ub proteins whereby the C terminus of Ub wraps around the E2 protein terminating in the thiolester between C88 (Ubc1(Delta450)) and G76 (Ub). The model supports in vivo and in vitro experiments of E2 derivatives carrying surface residue substitutions. Furthermore, the model provides insights into the arrangement of Ub, E2, and E3 within a ternary targeting complex.",PMID: 11591345 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

One of the isolated clones encodes the mu1 subunit of the adaptor complex AP-1 involved in clathrin-dependent protein sorting. We found that Doublecortin also interacts in yeast with mu2 from the AP-2 complex. Mutagenesis and pull-down experiments showed that these interactions were mediated through a tyrosine-based sorting signal (YLPL) in the C-terminal part of Doublecortin. The functional relevance of these interactions was suggested by the coimmunoprecipitation of Doublecortin with AP-1 and AP-2 from mouse brain extracts. This interaction was further supported by RNA in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence studies. Taken together these data indicate that a certain proportion of Doublecortin interacts with AP-1 and/or AP-2 in vivo and are consistent with a potential involvement of Doublecortin in protein sorting or vesicular trafficking.

We show that STAGA contains homologs of most yeast SAGA components, including two novel human proteins with histone-like folds and sequence relationships to yeast SPT7 and ADA1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that STAGA has acetyl coenzyme A-dependent transcriptional coactivator functions from a chromatin-assembled template in vitro and associates in HeLa cells with spliceosome-associated protein 130 (SAP130) and DDB1, two structurally related proteins. SAP130 is a component of the splicing factor SF3b that associates with U2 snRNP and is recruited to prespliceosomal complexes. DDB1 (p127) is a UV-damaged-DNA-binding protein that is involved, as part of a complex with DDB2 (p48), in nucleotide excision repair and the hereditary disease xeroderma pigmentosum. Our results thus suggest cellular roles of STAGA in chromatin modification, transcription, and transcription-coupled processes through direct physical interactions with sequence-specific transcription activators and with components of the splicing and DNA repair machineries.",PMID: 11564863 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Mechanisms controlling differential promoter-occupancy by the yeast forkhead proteins Fkh1p and Fkh2p: implications for regulating the cell cycle and differentiation.,"Hollenhorst PC, Pietz G, Fox CA.","Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA.","The roles of DNA and Mcm1p interactions in determining the overlapping and distinct functions of the yeast cell cycle regulatory transcription factors Fkh1p and Fkh2p were examined. Full-length recombinant Fkh1p and Fkh2p were purified and their binding to bona fide promoters examined in vitro. Each protein bound a variety of target promoters with similar specificity in vitro, consistent with the observation that these proteins bind common promoters in vivo. However, in vivo, the Fkh1p and Fkh2p occupied different target promoters to different extents, suggesting that each was primarily responsible for controlling a different set of genes. Additional in vitro studies provided a mechanistic explanation for this differential promoter-occupancy. Specifically, the Fkh2p, but not the Fkh1p, was capable of binding cooperatively with Mcm1p. The Mcm1p-Fkh2p cooperative binding was enhanced by, but did not require, the presence of a Mcm1p-binding site within a target promoter. Consistent with these data, Mcm1p was present at Fkh-controlled promoters in vivo regardless of whether they contained Mcm1p-binding sites, suggesting a role for Mcm1p at promoters not thought previously to be under Mcm1p control. Analysis of Fkh1p and Fkh2p binding to promoter targets in vivo by use of mutant strains indicated that the two proteins compete for promoter-occupancy at a number of target promoters. We postulate that Fkh1p and a stable Fkh2p/Mcm1p complex compete for binding to target promoters and that the levels and/or binding activity of Fkh1p, but not Fkh2p, are most limiting for promoter-occupancy in vivo. Interestingly, the in vitro DNA-binding assays, using a variety of promoter targets, revealed that bona fide Fkh target promoters contained two or more Fkh-binding sites that allowed the Fkh1p and Fkh2p proteins to form multiple protein-DNA complexes in vitro. Multiple Fkh-binding sites may be a distinguishing feature of bona fide Fkh promoters in yeast and other organisms.",PMID: 11562353 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Multiple interactions among the components of the recombinational DNA repair system in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.,"Tsutsui Y, Khasanov FK, Shinagawa H, Iwasaki H, Bashkirov VI.","Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.","Schizosaccharomyces pombe Rhp55 and Rhp57 are RecA-like proteins involved in double-strand break (DSB) repair. Here we demonstrate that Rhp55 and Rhp57 proteins strongly interact in vivo, similar to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad55p and Rad57p. Mutations in the conserved ATP-binding/hydrolysis folds of both the Rhp55 and Rhp57 proteins impaired their function in DNA repair but not in cell proliferation. However, when combined, ATPase fold mutations in Rhp55p and Rhp57p resulted in severe defects of both functions, characteristic of the deletion mutants. Yeast two-hybrid analysis also revealed other multiple in vivo interactions among S. pombe proteins involved in recombinational DNA repair. Similar to S. cerevisiae Rad51p-Rad54p, S. pombe Rhp51p and Rhp54p were found to interact. Both putative Rad52 homologs in S. pombe, Rad22p and Rti1p, were found to interact with the C-terminal region of Rhp51 protein. Moreover, Rad22p and Rti1p exhibited mutual, as well as self-, interactions. In contrast to the S. cerevisiae interacting pair Rad51p-Rad55p, S. pombe Rhp51 protein strongly interacted with Rhp57 but not with Rhp55 protein. In addition, the Rti1 and Rad22 proteins were found to form a complex with the large subunit of S. pombe RPA. Our data provide compelling evidence that most, but not all, of the protein-protein interactions found in S. cerevisiae DSB repair are evolutionarily conserved.",PMID: 11560889 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
The Ras/PKA signaling pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibits a functional interaction with the Sin4p complex of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme.,"Howard SC, Chang YW, Budovskaya YV, Herman PK.","Department of Molecular Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.","Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells enter into the G(0)-like resting state, stationary phase, in response to specific types of nutrient limitation. We have initiated a genetic analysis of this resting state and have identified a collection of rye mutants that exhibit a defective transcriptional response to nutrient deprivation. These transcriptional defects appear to disrupt the control of normal growth because the rye mutants are unable to enter into a normal stationary phase upon nutrient deprivation. In this study, we examined the mutants in the rye1 complementation group and found that rye1 mutants were also defective for stationary phase entry. Interestingly, the RYE1 gene was found to be identical to SIN4, a gene that encodes a component of the yeast Mediator complex within the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. Moreover, mutations that affected proteins within the Sin4p module of the Mediator exhibited specific genetic interactions with the Ras protein signaling pathway. For example, mutations that elevated the levels of Ras signaling, like RAS2(val19), were synthetic lethal with sin4. In all, our data suggest that specific proteins within the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme might be targets of signal transduction pathways that are responsible for coordinating gene expression with cell growth.",PMID: 11560888 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Functional interaction map of lyssavirus phosphoprotein: identification of the minimal transcription domains.,"Jacob Y, Real E, Tordo N.","Laboratoire des Lyssavirus, Institut Pasteur, 75724 Paris Cedex 15, France. yjacob@pasteur.fr","Lyssaviruses, the causative agents of rabies encephalitis, are distributed in seven genotypes. The phylogenetically distant rabies virus (PV strain, genotype 1) and Mokola virus (genotype 3) were used to develop a strategy to identify functional homologous interactive domains from two proteins (P and N) which participate in the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) transcription-replication complex. This strategy combined two-hybrid and green fluorescent protein-reverse two-hybrid assays in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to analyze protein-protein interactions and a reverse genetic assay in mammalian cells to study the transcriptional activity of the reconstituted RNP complex. Lyssavirus P proteins contain two N-binding domains (N-BDs), a strong one encompassing amino acid (aa) 176 to the C terminus and a weak one in the 189 N-terminal aa. The N-terminal portion of P (aa 52 to 189) also contains a homomultimerization site. Here we demonstrate that N-P interactions, although weaker, are maintained between proteins of the different genotypes. A minimal transcriptional module of the P protein was obtained by fusing the first 60 N-terminal aa containing the L protein binding site to the C-terminal strong N-BD. Random mutation of the strong N-BD on P protein identified three highly conserved K residues crucial for N-P interaction. Their mutagenesis in full-length P induced a transcriptionally defective RNP. The analysis of homologous interactive domains presented here and previously reported dissections of the P protein allowed us to propose a model of the functional interaction network of the lyssavirus P protein. This model underscores the central role of P at the interface between L protein and N-RNA template.",PMID: 11559793 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
The structural and functional organization of the yeast mediator complex.,"Kang JS, Kim SH, Hwang MS, Han SJ, Lee YC, Kim YJ.","National Creative Research Center for Genome Regulation, Department of Biochemistry, Yonsei University, Seoul 120-749, Korea.","The Mediator complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is required for diverse aspects of transcription by RNA polymerase II (pol II). Mediator is composed of two functionally distinct subcomplexes, Rgr1 and Srb4. To identify the structures and functions of each subcomplex, we expressed recombinant proteins for each subunit and assayed their interactions with each other and with basal transcription proteins. The Rgr1 subcomplex is composed of the Gal11 module, which binds activators, and the Med9/10 module. The Med9/10 module is required for both transcriptional activation and repression, and these activities appear to be carried out by two submodules. Proteins in the Med9 submodule interact physically and genetically with Srb10/11, suggesting that the Med9 submodule mediates the repression of pol II. Purified recombinant Srb4 subcomplex stimulated basal transcription of pol II but had little effect on activated transcription and phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of the Rpb1 subunit of pol II. Both subcomplexes of Mediator interacted with a distinct set of basal transcription factors and pol II. The modular organization of Mediator and the associated functions suggest that the Mediator complex may recruit and/or stabilize the preinitiation complex through several points of contact with transcriptional regulators and basal transcription factors.",PMID: 11555651 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Control of microtubule dynamics by Stu2p is essential for spindle orientation and metaphase chromosome alignment in yeast.,"Kosco KA, Pearson CG, Maddox PS, Wang PJ, Adams IR, Salmon ED, Bloom K, Huffaker TC.","Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853-2703, USA.","Stu2p is a member of a conserved family of microtubule-binding proteins and an essential protein in yeast. Here, we report the first in vivo analysis of microtubule dynamics in cells lacking a member of this protein family. For these studies, we have used a conditional Stu2p depletion strain expressing alpha-tubulin fused to green fluorescent protein. Depletion of Stu2p leads to fewer and less dynamic cytoplasmic microtubules in both G1 and preanaphase cells. The reduction in cytoplasmic microtubule dynamics is due primarily to decreases in both the catastrophe and rescue frequencies and an increase in the fraction of time microtubules spend pausing. These changes have significant consequences for the cell because they impede the ability of cytoplasmic microtubules to orient the spindle. In addition, recovery of fluorescence after photobleaching indicates that kinetochore microtubules are no longer dynamic in the absence of Stu2p. This deficiency is correlated with a failure to properly align chromosomes at metaphase. Overall, we provide evidence that Stu2p promotes the dynamics of microtubule plus-ends in vivo and that these dynamics are critical for microtubule interactions with kinetochores and cortical sites in the cytoplasm.",PMID: 11553724 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
The GTPase effector domain sequence of the Dnm1p GTPase regulates self-assembly and controls a rate-limiting step in mitochondrial fission.,"Fukushima NH, Brisch E, Keegan BR, Bleazard W, Shaw JM.","Department of Biology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.","Dnm1p belongs to a family of dynamin-related GTPases required to remodel different cellular membranes. In budding yeast, Dnm1p-containing complexes assemble on the cytoplasmic surface of the outer mitochondrial membrane at sites where mitochondrial tubules divide. Our previous genetic studies suggested that Dnm1p's GTPase activity was required for mitochondrial fission and that Dnm1p interacted with itself. In this study, we show that bacterially expressed Dnm1p can bind and hydrolyze GTP in vitro. Coimmunoprecipitation studies and yeast two-hybrid analysis suggest that Dnm1p oligomerizes in vivo. With the use of the yeast two-hybrid system, we show that this Dnm1p oligomerization is mediated, in part, by a C-terminal sequence related to the GTPase effector domain (GED) in dynamin. The Dnm1p interactions characterized here are similar to those reported for dynamin and dynamin-related proteins that form higher order structures in vivo, suggesting that Dnm1p assembles to form rings or collars that surround mitochondrial tubules. Based on previous findings, a K705A mutation in the Dnm1p GED is predicted to interfere with GTP hydrolysis, stabilize active Dnm1p-GTP, and stimulate a rate-limiting step in fission. Here we show that expression of the Dnm1 K705A protein in yeast enhances mitochondrial fission. Our results provide evidence that the GED region of a dynamin-related protein modulates a rate-limiting step in membrane fission.",PMID: 11553714 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
"Dad1p, third component of the Duo1p/Dam1p complex involved in kinetochore function and mitotic spindle integrity.","Enquist-Newman M, Cheeseman IM, Van Goor D, Drubin DG, Meluh PB, Barnes G.","Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-3202, USA.","We showed recently that a complex between Duo1p and Dam1p is required for both spindle integrity and kinetochore function in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To extend our understanding of the functions and interactions of the Duo1p/Dam1p complex, we analyzed the novel gene product Dad1p (for Duo1 and Dam1 interacting). Dad1p physically associates with Duo1p by two-hybrid analysis, coimmunoprecipitates with Duo1p and Dam1p out of yeast protein extracts, and shows interdependent localization with Duo1p and Dam1p to the mitotic spindle. These results indicate that Dad1p functions as a component of the Duo1p/Dam1p complex. Like Duo1p and Dam1p, Dad1p also localizes to kinetochore regions in chromosomes spreads. Here, we also demonstrate by chromatin immunoprecipitation that Duo1p, Dam1p, and Dad1p associate specifically with centromeric DNA in a manner that is dependent upon Ndc10 and partially dependent upon the presence of microtubules. To explore the functions of Dad1p in vivo, we generated a temperature-sensitive allele, dad1-1. This allele shows spindle defects and a mitotic arrest phenotype that is dependent upon the spindle assembly checkpoint. In addition, dad1-1 mutants undergo chromosome mis-segregation at the restrictive temperature, resulting in a dramatic decrease in viability.",PMID: 11553702 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
"Pitfalls in characterizing P450c17 mutations associated with isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency.","Gupta MK, Geller DH, Auchus RJ.","Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75390-8857, USA.","The cytochrome P450c17 enzyme system performs both the 17alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase reactions in the human adrenal glands and gonads. This 17,20-lyase activity is required for the biosynthesis of dehydroepiandrosterone, the C(19) precursor of sex steroids. Considerable evidence supports the idea that the 17,20-lyase activity of this system is particularly sensitive to alterations in the interactions between P450c17 and its cofactor proteins P450-oxidoreductase and cytochrome b(5). We have described two patients with the clinical phenotype of isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency in whom single amino acid replacement mutations in the redox partner binding site of P450c17 (R347H and R358Q) selectively ablate 17,20-lyase activity while preserving most 17alpha-hydroxylase activity. We have shown by computer modeling and detailed biochemical studies that mutations R347H and R358Q impair the interactions of P450c17 with P450-oxidoreductase and cytochrome b(5) (redox partners). Another mutation reported to cause isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency (F417C) does not map within the redox partner binding site, but might nonetheless alter the interaction of the mutant protein with redox partners. To study the interaction of the F417C mutation with P450 oxidoreductase and cytochrome b(5), we expressed the cDNA for this protein in yeast microsomes, a heterologous expression system in which the composition of redox partner proteins can be varied systematically. Although the full-length protein was expressed in quantities comparable to those of wild-type P450c17 in this system, the F417C mutation did not form a classical P450 difference spectrum and was devoid of both 17alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities. To ensure that this result was not unique to the yeast expression system, we also expressed wild-type P450c17 and the F417C mutation in COS-7 cells, and we again found that the F417C mutation was expressed, but was not active. To conclusively demonstrate that a particular mutation in P450c17 causes isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency, accurate enzymatic studies of the mutant protein must reproducibly show activities consistent with the diagnosis. Mutations R347H and R358Q are the only two such mutations found in humans proven to cause isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency.",PMID: 11549685 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Fluoroalcohol-induced structural changes of proteins: some aspects of cosolvent-protein interactions.,"Gast K, Siemer A, Zirwer D, Damaschun G.","Max-Delbruck-Centrum fur Molekulare Medizin Berlin-Buch, Germany. gast@mdc-berlin.de","The conformational transitions of bovine beta-lactoglobulin A and phosphoglycerate kinase from yeast induced by hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) and trifluoroethanol (TFE) have been studied by dynamic light scattering and circular dichroism spectroscopy in order to elucidate the potential of fluoroalcohols to bring about structural changes of proteins. Moreover, pure fluoroalcohol-water mixed solvents were investigated to prove the relation between cluster formation and the effects on proteins. The results demonstrate that cluster formation is mostly an accompanying phenomenon because important structural changes of the proteins occur well below the critical concentration of fluoroalcohol at which the formation of clusters sets in. According to our light scattering experiments, the remarkable potential of HFIP is a consequence of extensive preferential binding. Surprisingly, preferential binding seems to play a vanishing role in the case of TFE. However, the comparable Stokes radii of both proteins in the highly helical state induced by either HFIP or TFE point to a similar degree of solvation in both mixed solvents. This shows that direct binding or an indirect mechanism must be equally taken into consideration to explain the effects of alcohols on proteins. The existence of a compact helical intermediate with non-native secondary structure on the transition of beta-lactoglobulin A from the native to the highly helical state is clearly demonstrated.",PMID: 11548130 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Toxicity of human adenovirus E4orf4 protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae results from interactions with the Cdc55 regulatory B subunit of PP2A.,"Roopchand DE, Lee JM, Shahinian S, Paquette D, Bussey H, Branton PE.","Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, McIntyre Medical Building, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, H3G 1Y6.","The E4orf4 protein of human adenovirus induces p53-independent apoptosis, a process that may promote cell death and viral spread. When expressed alone, E4orf4 kills transformed cells but not normal human cells. The only clear target of E4orf4 in mammalian cells is the Balpha (B55) subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a member of one of three classes of regulatory B subunits. Here we report the effects of E4orf4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which encodes two PP2A regulatory B subunits, CDC55 and RTS1, that share homology with mammalian B and B' subunits, respectively. E4orf4 expression was found to be toxic in yeast, resulting in the accumulation of cells in G2/M phase that failed to grow upon removal of E4orf4. E4orf4-expressing yeast also displayed an elongated cell morphology similar to cdc55 deletion strains. E4orf4 required CDC55 to elicit its effect, whereas RTS1 was dispensable. The recruitment of the PP2A holoenzyme by E4orf4 was entirely dependent on Cdc55. These studies indicate that E4orf4-induced apoptosis in mammalian cells and cell death in yeast require functional interactions with B-type subunits of PP2A. However, some inhibition of growth by E4orf4 was observed in the cdc55 strain and with an E4orf4 mutant that fails to interact with Cdc55, indicating that E4orf4 may possess a second Cdc55-independent function affecting cell growth.",PMID: 11536041 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Binding of the merlin-I product of the neurofibromatosis type 2 tumour suppressor gene to a novel site in beta-fodrin is regulated by association between merlin domains.,"Neill GW, Crompton MR.","Centre for Cutaneous Research, St Bartholomew's and the Royal London, Queen Mary and Westfield College, 2 Newark Street, London E1 2AT, UK.","The mechanism underlying the tumour-suppressor activity of the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene product, merlin, is largely undefined but there is evidence that the biological function of the protein might be mediated partly through interactions with the cytoskeleton. Merlin is expressed predominantly as two isoforms that differ at their C-termini owing to alternative splicing of exon 16. By expressing merlin isoform I as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we isolated a clone encoding a region of the cytoskeletal protein beta-fodrin. Confirmation of the merlin-fodrin interaction was provided by using the mammalian two-hybrid system and binding assays in vitro. In addition, these assays and co-immunoprecipitation from mammalian cells revealed that the binding site for fodrin is located in the C-terminal half of merlin at a site that is masked in the native protein. Co-expression of the N-terminus of merlin decreased the interaction of its C-terminus with fodrin, implicating homophilic interactions of merlin isoform I in masking the fodrin-binding site. The effect of three disease-associated mutations on the merlin-fodrin interaction and merlin dimerization was also investigated. The mutation L535P, but not L360P or K413E, significantly decreased the merlin-fodrin interaction but not dimerization, indicating that the tumour suppressor ability of merlin might reside partly in its ability to interact with the cytoskeleton via fodrin.",PMID: 11535133 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Targeting of the yeast Ty5 retrotransposon to silent chromatin is mediated by interactions between integrase and Sir4p.,"Xie W, Gai X, Zhu Y, Zappulla DC, Sternglanz R, Voytas DF.","Department of Zoology and Genetics, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa 50011-3260, USA.","The Ty5 retrotransposons of Saccharomyces cerevisiae integrate preferentially into regions of silent chromatin at the telomeres and silent mating loci (HMR and HML). We define a Ty5-encoded targeting domain that spans 6 amino acid residues near the C terminus of integrase (LXSSXP). The targeting domain establishes silent chromatin when it is tethered to a weakened HMR-E silencer, and it disrupts telomeric silencing when it is overexpressed. As determined by both yeast two-hybrid and in vitro binding assays, the targeting domain interacts with the C terminus of Sir4p, a structural component of silent chromatin. This interaction is abrogated by mutations in the targeting domain that disrupt integration into silent chromatin, suggesting that recognition of Sir4p by the targeting domain is the primary determinant in Ty5 target specificity.",PMID: 11533248 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
A novel upstream RNA polymerase III promoter element becomes essential when the chromatin structure of the yeast U6 RNA gene is altered.,"Martin MP, Gerlach VL, Brow DA.","Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, University of Wisconsin Medical School, Madison, Wisconsin 53706-1532, USA.","The Saccharomyces cerevisiae U6 RNA gene, SNR6, possesses upstream sequences that allow productive binding in vitro of the RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcription initiation factor IIIB (TFIIIB) in the absence of TFIIIC or other assembly factors. TFIIIC-independent transcription of SNR6 in vitro is highly sensitive to point mutations in a consensus TATA box at position -30. In contrast, the TATA box is dispensable for SNR6 transcription in vivo, apparently because TFIIIC bound to the intragenic A block and downstream B block can recruit TFIIIB via protein-protein interactions. A mutant allele of SNR6 with decreased spacing between the A and B blocks, snr6-Delta42, exhibits increased dependence on the upstream sequences in vivo. Unexpectedly, we find that in vivo expression of snr6-Delta42 is much more sensitive to mutations in a (dT-dA)(7) tract between the TATA box and transcription start site than to mutations in the TATA box itself. Inversion of single base pairs in the center of the dT-dA tract nearly abolishes transcription of snr6-Delta42, yet inversion of all 7 base pairs has little effect on expression, indicating that the dA-dT tract is relatively orientation independent. Although it is within the TFIIIB footprint, point mutations in the dT-dA tract do not inhibit TFIIIB binding or TFIIIC-independent transcription of SNR6 in vitro. In the absence of the chromatin architectural protein Nhp6, dT-dA tract mutations are lethal even when A-to-B block spacing is wild type. We conclude that the (dT-dA)(7) tract and Nhp6 cooperate to direct productive transcription complex assembly on SNR6 in vivo.",PMID: 11533232 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

Inappropriate expression of Tcf target genes resulting from mutational activation of this pathway is also implicated in tumorigenesis. The C-terminus of beta-catenin is indispensable for the transactivation function, which probably reflects the presence of binding sites for essential transcriptional coactivators such as p300/CBP. However, the precise mechanism of transactivation remains unclear. Here we demonstrate an interaction between beta-catenin and Brg-1, a component of mammalian SWI/SNF and Rsc chromatin-remodelling complexes. A functional consequence of reintroduction of Brg-1 into Brg-1-deficient cells is enhanced activity of a Tcf-responsive reporter gene. Consistent with this, stable expression of inactive forms of Brg-1 in colon carcinoma cell lines specifically inhibits expression of endogenous Tcf target genes. In addition, we observe genetic interactions between the Brg-1 and beta-catenin homologues in flies. We conclude that beta-catenin recruits Brg-1 to Tcf target gene promoters, facilitating chromatin remodelling as a prerequisite for transcriptional activation.",PMID: 11532957 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

In the major 5'-to-3' decay pathway, the deadenylation triggers removal of the 5'-cap, exposing the transcript body for 5'-to-3' degradation. An alternative 3'-to-5' decay pathway also follows the deadenylation and requires two multi-complexes: the exosome containing various 3'-exonucleases and the Ski complex consisting of the RNA helicase Ski2p, Ski3p and Ski8p. In addition, Ski7p, which has an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal elongation factor 1alpha-like GTP-binding domain, is involved in the 3'-to-5' decay. However, physical interaction between the exosome and the Ski complex, together with the function of Ski7p, has remained unknown. Here we report that the N domain of Ski7p is required and sufficient for the 3'-to-5' decay. Furthermore, the exosome and the Ski complex interact with the different regions of Ski7p N domain, and both interactions are required for the 3'-to-5' decay. Thus, Ski7p G protein appears to function as a signal-coupling factor between the two multi-complexes operating in the 3'-to-5' mRNA-decay pathway.",PMID: 11532933 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Hepatitis B virus X protein interferes with cell viability through interaction with the p127-kDa UV-damaged DNA-binding protein.,"Lin-Marq N, Bontron S, Leupin O, Strubin M.","Department of Genetics and Microbiology, University Medical Centre, Rue Michel-Servet 1, Geneva 4, 1211, Switzerland.","The hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) is essential for establishing natural viral infection and has been implicated in the development of liver cancer associated with chronic infection. The basis for HBx function in either process is not understood. In cell culture, HBx exhibits pleiotropic activities affecting transcription, DNA repair, cell growth, and apoptotic cell death. Numerous cellular proteins including the p127-kDa subunit of UV-damaged DNA-binding activity have been reported to interact with HBx but the functional significance of these interactions remains unclear. Here we show that the binding of HBx to p127 interferes with cell viability. Mutational analysis reveals that HBx contacts p127 via a region to which no function has been assigned previously. An HBx variant bearing a single-charge reversal substitution within this region loses p127 binding and concomitant cytotoxicity. This mutant regains activity when directly fused to p127. These studies confirm that p127 is an important cellular target of HBx, and they indicate that HBx does not exert its effect by sequestering p127, and thereby preventing its normal function, but instead by conferring to p127 a deleterious activity.

It has 28 bp terminal inverted repeats and like other elements of this type it transposes by a cut and paste mechanism, inserts at TA dinucleotides and codes for a transposase. This is the only protein required for transposition in vitro. We have investigated the DNA binding properties of Mos1 transposase and the role of transposase-transposase interactions in transposition. Purified transposase recognises the terminal inverted repeats of Mos1 due to a DNA-binding domain in the N-terminal 120 amino acids. This requires a putative helix-turn-helix motif between residues 88 and 108. Binding is preferentially to the right hand end, which differs at four positions from the repeat at the left end. Cleavage of Mos1 by transposase is also preferentially at the right hand end. Wild-type transposase monomers interact with each other in a yeast two-hybrid assay and we have used this to isolate mutations resulting in reduced interaction. These mutations lie along the length of the protein, indicating that transposase-transposase interactions are not due to a single interaction domain. One such mutation which retains both DNA-binding and catalytic activity has greatly reduced ability to excise Mos1 from plasmid DNA through coordinate cleavage of the two ends and transposition in vitro is lowered to a level 20-fold below that of the wild-type. This suggests that transposase-transposase interaction is required to form a synaptic complex necessary for coordinate cleavage at the ends of Mos1 during transposition. This mutant enzyme allows insertion at dinucleotides other than TA, including sequences with GC base pairs. This is the first example of a mariner/Tc1 transposase with altered target specificity."

Furthermore, the mean similarity of expression profiles is significantly higher for respective interacting protein pairs than for random ones. Such coupled analysis of gene expression and protein interaction data may allow evaluation of the results of large-scale gene expression and protein interaction screens as demonstrated for several publicly available datasets. The role of this link between expression and interaction in the evolution from monomeric to oligomeric protein structures is also discussed."

Canfield Ave., Detroit, MI 48201, USA.","Atp11p is a soluble protein of mitochondria that binds unassembled beta subunits of the F(1)-ATPase and prevents them from aggregating in the matrix. In this report, we show that Atp11p protects the insulin B chain from aggregating in vitro and therefore acts as a molecular chaperone. The chaperone action of Atp11p is mediated by hydrophobic interactions. An accessible hydrophobic surface in Atp11p was identified with the environment-sensitive fluorescent probe 1,1'-bis(4-anilino-5-napththalenesulfonic acid (bis-ANS). The spectral changes of bis-ANS in the presence of Atp11p indicate that the probe binds to a nonpolar region of the protein. Furthermore, the dye quenches the fluorescence of Atp11p tryptophan residues in a concentration-dependent manner. Although up to three molecules of bis-ANS can bind cooperatively to Atp11p, the binding of only one dye molecule is sufficient to virtually eliminate the chaperone activity of the protein."

The conserved glycine 131 is involved in the packing of heme b(L) and is separated by only 3 A from this heme in the bc(1) complex structure. The cytochrome b respiratory deficient mutant G131S is affected in the assembly of the bc(1) complex. An intragenic suppressor mutation was obtained at position 260, in the ef loop, where a glycine was replaced by an alanine. This respiratory competent revertant exhibited a low bc(1) complex activity and was affected in the electron transfer at the Q(P) site. The k(min) for the substrate DBH(2) was diminished by an order of magnitude and EPR spectra showed a partially empty Q(P) site. However, the binding of the Q(P) site inhibitors stigmatellin and myxothiazol remained unchanged in the suppressor strain. Optical spectroscopy revealed that heme b(L) is red shifted by 0.8 nm and that the E(m) of heme b(L) was slightly increased (+20 mV) in the revertant strain as compared to wild type strain values. Addition of a methyl group at position 260 is thus sufficient to allow the assembly of the bc(1) complex and the insertion of heme b(L) despite the presence of the serine at position 131. Surprisingly, reversion at position 260 was located 13 A away from the original mutation and revealed a long distance interaction in the yeast bc(1) complex."

Kex2 can be distinguished from degradative subtilisins on the basis of stringent substrate specificity and distinct pre-steady-state behavior. To better understand these mechanistic differences, we have examined the effects of substrate residues at P(1) and P(4) on individual steps in the Kex2 catalytic cycle with a systematic series of isosteric peptidyl amide and ester substrates. The results demonstrate that substrates based on known, physiological cleavage sites exhibit high acylation rates (> or =550 s(-1)) with Kex2. Substitution of Lys for the physiologically correct Arg at P(1) resulted in a > or =200-fold drop in acylation rate with almost no apparent effect on binding or deacylation. In contrast, substitution of the physiologically incorrect Ala for Nle at P(4) resulted in a much smaller defect in acylation and a modest but significant effect on binding with Lys at P(1). This substitution also had no effect on deacylation. These results demonstrate that Kex2 utilizes enzyme-substrate interactions in different ways at different steps in the catalytic cycle, with the S(1)-P(1) contact providing a key specificity determinant at the acylation step."

Both inhibitors bind by forming a Schiff base link with Lys 263 at the active site. Previous inhibitor binding studies have defined the interactions made by only one of the two substrate moieties (P-side substrate) which bind to the enzyme during catalysis. The structures reported here provide an improved definition of the interactions made by both of the substrate molecules (A- and P-side substrates). The most intriguing result is the novel finding that 4,7-dioxosebacic acid forms a second Schiff base with the enzyme involving Lys 210. It has been known for many years that P-side substrate forms a Schiff base (with Lys 263) but until now there has been no evidence that binding of A-side substrate involves formation of a Schiff base with the enzyme. A catalytic mechanism involving substrate linked to the enzyme through Schiff bases at both the A- and P-sites is proposed."

Here we show that loss of H2A.Z in this organism negatively affects the induction of GAL genes. Importantly, fusion of the H2A.Z C-terminal region to S phase H2A without its corresponding C-terminal region can mediate the variant histone's specialized function in GAL1-10 gene induction, and it restores the slow-growth phenotype of cells with a deletion of HTZ1. Furthermore, we show that the C-terminal region of H2A.Z can interact with some components of the transcriptional apparatus. In cells lacking H2A.Z, recruitment of RNA polymerase II and TATA-binding protein to the GAL1-10 promoters is significantly diminished under inducing conditions. Unexpectedly, we also find that H2A.Z is required to globally maintain chromatin integrity under GAL gene-inducing conditions. We hypothesize that H2A.Z can positively regulate gene transcription, at least in part, by modulating interactions with RNA polymerase II-associated factors at certain genes under specific cell growth conditions."

In yeast, HSF is constitutively bound to DNA; however, the mitigation of negative regulation in response to stress dramatically increases transcriptional activity. Through alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the surface residues of the DNA-binding domain, we have identified a large number of mutants with increased transcriptional activity. Six of the strongest mutations were selected for detailed study. Our studies suggest that the DNA-binding domain is involved in the negative regulation of both the N-terminal and C-terminal activation domains of HSF. These mutations do not significantly affect DNA binding. Circular dichroism analysis suggests that a subset of the mutants may have altered secondary structure, whereas a different subset has decreased thermal stability. Our findings suggest that the regulation of HSF transcriptional activity (under both constitutive and stressed conditions) may be partially dependent on the local topology of the DNA-binding domain. In addition, the DNA-binding domain may mediate key interactions with ancillary factors and/or other intramolecular regulatory regions in order to modulate the complex regulation of HSF's transcriptional activity."

The binding site of Ste20p to the Gbeta subunit was mapped to a consensus sequence of SSLphiPLI/VXphiphibeta (X for any residue; phi for A, I, L, S or T; beta for basic residues), which was shown to be a novel Gbeta binding (GBB) motif present only in the noncatalytic C-terminal domains of the Ste20p/PAK family of protein kinases (Leeuw, T., Wu, C., Schrag, J.

Here, we report the results of an NMR study on two GBB motif peptides and the entire C-terminal domain derived from Ste20p. The NMR data show that the two peptide fragments are not uniquely structured in aqueous solution, but in the presence of 40% trifluoroethanol, the longer 37-residue peptide exhibited two well defined, but flexibly linked helical structure elements. Heteronuclear NMR data indicate that the fully functional 86-residue C-terminal domain of Ste20p is again unfolded in aqueous solution but has helical secondary structure preferences similar to those of the two peptide fragments. The NMR results on the two GBB peptides and the entire GBB domain all indicate that the two important binding residues, Ser(879) and Ser(880), are located at the junction between two helical segments. These experimental observations with the prototype GBB domain of a novel family of Gbeta-controlled effectors may have important implications in understanding the molecular mechanisms of the signal transduction from the heterotrimeric G protein to the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade."

Crichton@bioc.ucl.ac.be","Iron and copper are metals which play an important role in the living world. From a brief consideration of their chemistry and biochemistry we conclude that the early chemistry of life used water soluble ferrous iron while copper was in the water-insoluble Cu(I) state as highly insoluble sulphides. The advent of oxygen was a catastrophic event for most living organisms, and can be considered to be the first general irreversible pollution of the earth. In contrast to the oxidation of iron and its loss of bioavailability as insoluble Fe(III), the oxidation of insoluble Cu(I) led to soluble Cu(II). A new iron biochemistry became possible after the advent of oxygen, with the development of chelators of Fe(III), which rendered iron once again accessible, and with the control of the potential toxicity of iron by its storage in a water soluble, non-toxic, bio-available storage protein (ferritin). Biology also discovered that whereas enzymes involved in anaerobic metabolism were designed to operate in the lower portion of the redox spectrum, the arrival of dioxygen created the need for a new redox active metal which could attain higher redox potentials. Copper, now bioavailable, was ideally suited to exploit the oxidizing power of dioxygen. The arrival of copper also coincided with the development of multicellular organisms which had extracellular cross-linked matrices capable of resisting attack by oxygen free radicals. After the initial 'iron age' subsequent evolution moved, not towards a 'copper age', but rather to an 'iron-copper' age. In the second part of the review, this symbiosis of iron and copper is examined in yeast. We then briefly consider iron and copper metabolism in mammals, before looking at iron-copper interactions in mammals, particularly man, and conclude with the reflection that, as in Greek and Roman mythology, a better understanding of the potentially positive interactions between Mars (iron) and Venus (copper) can only be to the advantage of our species."

"Gene activity in a eukaryotic cell is regulated by accessory factors to RNA polymerase II, which include the general transcription factor complex TFIID, composed of TBP and TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Three TAFs that contain histone fold motifs (yTAF17, yTAF60 and yTAF61) are critical for transcriptional regulation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and are found in both TFIID and SAGA, a multicomponent histone acetyltransferase transcriptional coactivator. Although these three TAFs were proposed to assemble into a pseudooctamer complex, we find instead that yTAF17, yTAF60 and yTAF61 form a specific TAF octamer complex with a fourth TAF found in TFIID, yTAF48. We have reconstituted this complex in vitro and established that it is an octamer containing two copies each of the four components. Point mutations within the histone folds disrupt the octamer in vitro, and temperature-sensitive mutations in the histone folds can be specifically suppressed by overexpressing the other TAF octamer components in vivo. Our results indicate that the TAF octamer is similar both in stoichiometry and histone fold interactions to the histone octamer component of chromatin.",PMID: 11473260 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,134: Biochim Biophys Acta  2001 Jun 29;1532(3):234-47 ,"A genetic screen for ethanolamine auxotrophs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae identifies a novel mutation in Mcd4p, a protein implicated in glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor synthesis."
"A genetic screen for ethanolamine auxotrophs has identified a novel mutant allele of the morphogenesis checkpoint dependent (MCD)-4 gene, designated mcd4-P301L. In the presence of a null allele for the phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) decarboxylase 1 gene (psd1 Delta), the mcd4-P301L mutation confers temperature sensitivity for growth on minimal medium. This growth defect is reversed by either ethanolamine or choline supplementation. Incubation of mutant cells with [(3)H]serine followed by analysis of the aminoglycerophospholipids demonstrated a 60% decrease in phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) formation compared to parental cells. Chemical analysis of phospholipid content after culture under non-permissive conditions also demonstrated a 60% decrease in the PtdEtn pool compared to the parental strain. Although the morphogenesis checkpoint dependent (MCD)-4 gene and its homologues have been shown to play a role in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor synthesis, the mcd4-P301L strain displayed normal incorporation of [(3)H]inositol into both proteins and lipids. Thus, a defect in GPI anchor synthesis does not explain either the ethanolamine auxotrophy or biochemical phenotype of this mutant. We also examined the growth characteristics and PtdSer metabolism of a previously described mcd4-174 mutant strain, with defects in GPI anchor synthesis, protein modification and cell wall maintenance. The mcd4-174, psd1 Delta strain is a temperature sensitive ethanolamine auxotroph that requires osmotic support for growth, and displays normal PtdEtn formation compared to parental cells. These results reveal important genetic interactions between PSD1 and MCD4 genes, and provide evidence that Mcd4p can modulate aminoglycerophospholipid metabolism, in a way independent of its role in GPI anchor synthesis.",PMID: 11470244 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,135: Biochemistry  2001 Jul 31;40(30):9049-58 ,Temperature-induced denaturation and renaturation of triosephosphate isomerase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae: evidence of dimerization coupled to refolding of the thermally unfolded protein.
"The thermal denaturation of the dimeric enzyme triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was studied by spectroscopic and calorimetric methods. At low protein concentration the structural transition proved to be reversible in thermal scannings conducted at a rate greater than 1.0 degrees C min(-1). Under these conditions, however, the denaturation-renaturation cycle exhibited marked hysteresis. The use of lower scanning rates lead to pronounced irreversibility. Kinetic studies indicated that denaturation of the enzyme likely consists of an initial first-order reaction that forms thermally unfolded (U) TIM, followed by irreversibility-inducing reactions which are probably linked to aggregation of the unfolded protein. As judged from CD measurements, U possesses residual secondary structure but lacks most of the tertiary interactions present in native TIM. Furthermore, the large increment in heat capacity upon denaturation suggests that extensive exposure of surface area occurs when U is formed. Above 63 degrees C, reactions leading to irreversibility were much slower than the unfolding process; as a result, U was sufficiently long-lived as to allow an investigation of its refolding kinetics. We found that U transforms into nativelike TIM through a second-order reaction in which association is coupled to the regain of secondary structure. The rate constants for unfolding and refolding of TIM displayed temperature dependences resembling those reported for monomeric proteins but with considerably larger activation enthalpies. Such large temperature dependences seem to be determinant for the occurrence of kinetically controlled transitions and thus constitute a simple explanation for the hysteresis observed in thermal scannings.",PMID: 11467968 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,136: J Bacteriol  2001 Aug;183(16):4761-70 ,Domain interactions in the yeast ATP binding cassette transporter Ycf1p: intragenic suppressor analysis of mutations in the nucleotide binding domains.
"The yeast cadmium factor (Ycf1p) is a vacuolar ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter required for heavy metal and drug detoxification. Cluster analysis shows that Ycf1p is strongly related to the human multidrug-associated protein (MRP1) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and therefore may serve as an excellent model for the study of eukaryotic ABC transporter structure and function. Identifying intramolecular interactions in these transporters may help to elucidate energy transfer mechanisms during transport. To identify regions in Ycf1p that may interact to couple ATPase activity to substrate binding and/or movement across the membrane, we sought intragenic suppressors of ycf1 mutations that affect highly conserved residues presumably involved in ATP binding and/or hydrolysis. Thirteen intragenic second-site suppressors were identified for the D777N mutation which affects the invariant Asp residue in the Walker B motif of the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1). Two of the suppressor mutations (V543I and F565L) are located in the first transmembrane domain (TMD1), nine (A1003V, A1021T, A1021V, N1027D, Q1107R, G1207D, G1207S, S1212L, and W1225C) are found within TMD2, one (S674L) is in NBD1, and another one (R1415G) is in NBD2, indicating either physical proximity or functional interactions between NBD1 and the other three domains. The original D777N mutant protein exhibits a strong defect in the apparent affinity for ATP and V(max) of transport. The phenotypic characterization of the suppressor mutants shows that suppression does not result from restoring these alterations but rather from a change in substrate specificity.

"At the end of the 35S rRNA gene within ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats in Saccharomyces cerevisiae lies an enhancer that has been shown to greatly stimulate rDNA transcription in ectopic reporter systems. We found, however, that the enhancer is not necessary for normal levels of rRNA synthesis from chromosomal rDNA or for cell growth. Yeast strains which have the entire enhancer from rDNA deleted did not show any defects in growth or rRNA synthesis. We found that the stimulatory activity of the enhancer for ectopic reporters is not observed in cells with disrupted nucleolar structures, suggesting that reporter genes are in general poorly accessible to RNA polymerase I (Pol I) machinery in the nucleolus and that the enhancer improves accessibility.

FOB1 is required for recombination hot spot (HOT1) activity, which also requires the enhancer region, and for recombination within rDNA repeats.

"Rad54 and Rad51 are important proteins for the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks by homologous recombination in eukaryotes. As previously shown, Rad51 protein forms nucleoprotein filaments on single-stranded DNA, and Rad54 protein directly interacts with such filaments to enhance synapsis, the homologous pairing with a double-stranded DNA partner. Here we demonstrate that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad54 protein has an additional role in the postsynaptic phase of DNA strand exchange by stimulating heteroduplex DNA extension of established joint molecules in Rad51/Rpa-mediated DNA strand exchange. This function depended on the ATPase activity of Rad54 protein and on specific protein:protein interactions between the yeast Rad54 and Rad51 proteins.",PMID: 11459988 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,139: Mol Genet Genomics  2001 Jun;265(4):705-10 ,"Genetic interactions within TFIIIC, the promoter-binding factor of yeast RNA polymerase III."
"TFIIIC is a heteromultimeric protein, made of six distinct subunits in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, that binds to RNA polymerase III promoters and triggers the assembly of the transcription complex. The largest yeast subunit tau138, encoded by TFC3, binds to the B-box promoter element. This binding is defective in the temperature-sensitive mutant tfc3-G349E; the mutation responsible is located in one of two conserved motifs shared with the B-binding component of human TFIIIC. Rare dominant gain-of-function mutations that restore growth at high temperature were obtained following ultraviolet mutagenesis of tfc3-G349E. All of them resulted from single amino acid substitutions that alter the structure of TFIIIC. Three were due to reversion or intragenic suppression (TFC3-K754E and TFC3-L804H) events. Three were identical isolates of TFC6-E330K, a previously described mutation of the tau91 subunit. The remaining suppressors mapped in TFC4, and resulted in amino acid replacements in the second largest subunit of TFIIIC (tau131). With the exception TFC4-E711K, these affect positions that are invariant between the S. cerevisiae and Homo sapiens proteins, and are localised in conserved tetratricopeptide motifs. These findings demonstrate a close functional interaction between the two largest subunits of TFIIIC and underscore the importance of the tetratricopeptide motif of tau131.",PMID: 11459191 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,140: J Biol Chem  2001 Sep 14;276(37):34832-9 ,Modulation of myosin function by isoform-specific properties of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and muscle tropomyosins.
"Tropomyosin is an extended coiled-coil protein that influences actin function by binding longitudinally along thin filaments. The present work compares cardiac tropomyosin and the two tropomyosins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TPM1 and TPM2, that are much shorter than vertebrate tropomyosins. Unlike cardiac tropomyosin, the phase of the coiled-coil-forming heptad repeat of TPM2 is discontinuous; it is interrupted by a 4-residue deletion. TPM1 has two such deletions, which flank the 38-residue partial gene duplication that causes TPM1 to span five actins instead of the four of TPM2. Each of the three tropomyosin isoforms modulates actin-myosin interactions, with isoform-specific effects on cooperativity and strength of myosin binding. These different properties can be explained by a model that combines opposite effects, steric hindrance between myosin and tropomyosin when the latter is bound to a subset of its sites on actin, and also indirect, favorable interactions between tropomyosin and myosin, mediated by mutually promoted changes in actin. Both of these effects are influenced by which tropomyosin isoform is present. Finally, the tropomyosins have isoform-specific effects on in vitro sliding speed and on the myosin concentration dependence of this movement, suggesting that non-muscle tropomyosin isoforms exist, at least in part, to modulate myosin function.",PMID: 11457840 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,141: J Biol Chem  2001 Sep 14;276(37):34948-57 ,Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein Pci8p and human protein eIF3e/Int-6 interact with the eIF3 core complex by binding to cognate eIF3b subunits.
"Mammalian, plant, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe eukaryotic initiation factor-3 (eIF3) contains a protein homologous to the product of int-6 (eIF3e), a frequent integration site of mouse mammary tumor viruses. By contrast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not encode a protein closely related to eIF3e/Int-6. Here, we characterize a novel S. cerevisiae protein (Pci8p, Yil071cp) that contains a PCI (proteasome-COP9 signalosome-eIF3) domain conserved in eIF3e/Int-6. We show that both Pci8p and human eIF3e/Int-6 expressed in budding yeast interact with the yeast eIF3 complex in vivo and in vitro by binding to a discrete segment of its eIF3b subunit Prt1p and that human eIF3e/Int-6 interacts with the human eIF3b segment homologous to the Pci8p-binding site of yeast Prt1p. These results refine our understanding of subunit interactions in the eIF3 complex and suggest structural similarity between human eIF3e/Int-6 and yeast Pci8p. However, deletion of PCI8 had no discernible effect on cell growth or translation initiation as judged by polysome analysis, suggesting that Pci8p is not required for the essential function of eIF3 in translation initiation. Motivated by the involvement of Int-6 in transcriptional control, we investigated the effects of deleting PCI8 on the total mRNA expression profile by oligonucleotide microarray analysis and found reduced mRNA levels for a subset of heat shock proteins in the pci8Delta mutant.

"Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet irradiation and various chemical agents that cause bulky adducts. Two subpathways within NER remove damage from the genome overall or the transcribed strands of transcribing genes (TCR). TCR is a faster repair process than overall genomic repair and has been thought to require the RAD26 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Rad26 is a member of the SWI/SNF family of proteins that either disrupt chromatin or facilitate interactions between the RNA Pol II and transcription activators. SWI/SNF proteins are required for the expression or repression of a diverse set of genes, many of which are differentially transcribed in response to particular carbon sources. The remodeling of chromatin by Rad26 could affect transcription and/or TCR following formation of DNA damage and other stress-inducing conditions. We speculate that another factor(s) can substitute for Rad26 under particular growth conditions. We therefore measured the level of repair and transcription in two different carbon sources and found that the defect in the rad26 mutant for TCR was dependent on the type of carbon source. Furthermore, TCR did not correlate with transcription rate, suggesting that disruption of RAD26 leads to a specific defect in DNA repair and not transcription.",PMID: 11454749 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,143: Curr Opin Cell Biol  2001 Aug;13(4):399-404 ,Ion homeostasis during salt stress in plants.

Expression of a truncated version of Pak2p lacking its N-terminal autoinhibitory domain led to a growth defect that was suppressed by deltamkh1 and deltaspm1 null mutations and an elongated cell phenotype indicative of a cell division defect that was suppressed by the deltamkh1 mutation. In addition, expression of the constitutively activated cdc42G12V mutant allele led to a growth defect that was rescued by the deltapak2 and deltamkh1 mutations. The deltapak2 mutation did not suppress the growth defect conferred by plasmid expression of Mkh1p, suggesting that Pak2p functions upstream of Mkh1p in this pathway. A two-hybrid protein interaction was observed between Pak2p and Mkh1p, but not between Pak1p and Mkh1p.

Proteolytic digestion of Dna2 using subtilisin produced a 127 kDa polypeptide that lacked the 45 kDa N-terminal region of Dna2. Further digestion generated two subtilisin-resistant core fragments of approximately equal size, 58 and 60 kDa. Surprisingly, digestion resulted in a significant (3- to 8-fold) increase in both ATPase and endonuclease activities compared to the intact enzyme. However, cells with a mutant DNA2 allele lacking the corresponding N-terminal region were severely impaired in growth, being unable to grow at 37 degrees C, indicating that the N-terminal region contains a domain critical for a cellular function(s) of Dna2. Analyses of the hydrodynamic properties of and in vivo complex formation by wild-type and/or mutant Dna2 lacking the N-terminal 45 kDa domain revealed that Dna2 is active as the monomer and thus the defect in the mutant Dna2 protein is not due to its inability to multimerize. In addition, we found that the N-terminal 45 kDa domain interacts physically with a central region located between the two catalytic domains. Our results suggest that the N-terminal 45 kDa domain of Dna2 plays a critical role in regulation of the enzymatic activities of Dna2 by serving as a site for intra- and intermolecular interactions essential for optimal function of Dna2 in Okazaki fragment processing. The possible mode of regulation of Dna2 is discussed based upon our recent finding that replication protein A interacts functionally and physically with Dna2 during Okazaki fragment processing.",PMID: 11452032 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,146: Bioinformatics  2001 Jul;17(7):669-71

Though several methods exist for identification of individual protein binding site patterns in DNA sequences, there are few methods for discovery of binding site patterns for cooperatively acting factors. Here we present an algorithm, Co-Bind (for COperative BINDing), for discovering DNA target sites for cooperatively acting transcription factors. The method utilizes a Gibbs sampling strategy to model the cooperativity between two transcription factors and defines position weight matrices for the binding sites. Sequences from both the training set and the entire genome are taken into account, in order to discriminate against commonly occurring patterns in the genome, and produce patterns which are significant only in the training set. RESULTS: We have tested Co-Bind on semi-synthetic and real data sets to show it can efficiently identify DNA target site patterns for cooperatively binding transcription factors. In cases where binding site patterns are weak and cannot be identified by other available methods, Co-Bind, by virtue of modeling the cooperativity between factors, can identify those sites efficiently. Though developed to model protein-DNA interactions, the scope of Co-Bind may be extended to combinatorial, sequence specific, interactions in other macromolecules.

Previous studies showed that the ribosome-inactivating protein pokeweed antiviral protein specifically inhibited propagation of the Ty1 retrotransposable element of yeast as a consequence of inhibition of programmed +1 ribosomal frameshifting. Here, complementary genetic and pharmacological approaches were employed to test whether inhibition of Ty1 retrotransposition is a general feature of alterations in the translocation step of elongation and +1 frameshifting.

The structure of the ATP binding site makes it a member of a new class of ATP-hydrolyzing enzymes, known as the GHKL family. While for some of the family members structural data on conformational changes occurring after ATP binding are available, these are still lacking for Hsp90. Here we set out to investigate the correlation between dimerization and ATP hydrolysis by Hsp90. The dimerization constant of wild type (WT) Hsp90 was determined to be 60 nm. Heterodimers of WT Hsp90 with fragments lacking the ATP binding domain form readily and exhibit dimerization constants similar to full-length Hsp90. However, the ATPase activity of these heterodimers was significantly lower than that of the wild type protein, indicating cooperative interactions in the N-terminal part of the protein that lead to the activation of the ATPase activity. To further address the contribution of the N-terminal domains to the ATPase activity, we used an Hsp90 point mutant that is unable to bind ATP. Since heterodimers between the WT protein and this mutant showed WT ATPase activity, this mutant, although unable to bind ATP, still has the ability to stimulate the activity in its WT partner domain. Thus, contact formation between the N-terminal domains might not depend on ATP bound to both domains.

In a screen starting with an exo1 mutation, exo1-dependent mutator mutations were obtained in MLH1, PMS1, MSH2, MSH3, POL30 (PCNA), POL32, and RNR1, whereas starting with the weak pms1 allele pms1-A130V, pms1-dependent mutator mutations were identified in MLH1, MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, and EXO1. These mutations only cause weak MMR defects as single mutants but cause strong MMR defects when combined with each other. Most of the mutations obtained caused amino acid substitutions in MLH1 or PMS1, and these clustered in either the ATP-binding region or the MLH1-PMS1 interaction regions of these proteins. The mutations showed two other types of interactions: specific pairs of mutations showed unlinked noncomplementation in diploid strains, and the defect caused by pairs of mutations could be suppressed by high-copy-number expression of a third gene, an effect that showed allele and overexpressed gene specificity.

Binding of viral dsRNAs to two dsRNA-binding domains (dsRBDs) in PKR leads to relief of an inhibitory region and activation of eIF2 kinase activity. Interestingly, while deletion of the regulatory region of PKR significantly induces activity in vitro, the truncated kinase does not inhibit translation in vivo, suggesting that these sequences carry out additional functions required for PKR control. To delineate these functions and determine the order of events leading to activation of PKR, we fused truncated PKR to domains of known function and assayed the chimeras for in vivo activity. We found that fusion of a heterologous dimerization domain with the PKR catalytic domain enhanced autophosphorylation and eIF2 kinase function in vivo. The dsRBDs also mediate ribosome association and we proposed that such targeting increases the localized concentration of PKR, enhancing interaction between PKR molecules. We addressed this premise by linking the truncated PKR to RAS sequences mediating farnesylation and membrane localization and found that the fusion protein was functional in vivo. These results indicate that cellular localization along with oligomerization enhances interaction between PKR molecules. Alanine substitution for the phosphorylation site, threonine 446, impeded in vivo and in vitro activity of the PKR fusion proteins, while aspartate or glutamate substitutions partially restored the function of the truncated kinase.

Irrespective of the growth phase, the srs2 mutation reduces the frequency of damage-induced ectopic gene conversion in rad5 and rad18 mutants. In addition, we find that srs2 mutants exhibit reduced spontaneous and UV-induced sister chromatid recombination (SCR), whereas rad5 and rad18 mutants are proficient for SCR. We propose a model in which the Srs2 protein has pro-recombinogenic or anti-recombinogenic activity, depending on the context of the DNA damage.",PMID: 11425518 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,160: RNA  2001 Jun;7(6):833-45 
"Institute of Molecular Biophysics, Florida State University, Tallahassee 32306-4380, USA.","The removal of noncoding sequences (introns) from eukaryotic precursor mRNA is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a dynamic assembly involving specific and sequential RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions. An essential RNA-RNA pairing between the U2 small nuclear (sn)RNA and a complementary consensus sequence of the intron, called the branch site, results in positioning of the 2'OH of an unpaired intron adenosine residue to initiate nucleophilic attack in the first step of splicing. To understand the structural features that facilitate recognition and chemical activity of the branch site, duplexes representing the paired U2 snRNA and intron sequences from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were examined by solution NMR spectroscopy. Oligomers were synthesized with pseudouridine (psi) at a conserved site on the U2 snRNA strand (opposite an A-A dinucleotide on the intron strand, one of which forms the branch site) and with uridine, the unmodified analog. Data from NMR spectra of nonexchangeable protons demonstrated A-form helical backbone geometry and continuous base stacking throughout the unmodified molecule. Incorporation of psi at the conserved position, however, was accompanied by marked deviation from helical parameters and an extrahelical orientation for the unpaired adenosine. Incorporation of psi also stabilized the branch-site interaction, contributing -0.7 kcal/mol to duplex deltaG degrees 37. These findings suggest that the presence of this conserved U2 snRNA pseudouridine induces a change in the structure and stability of the branch-site sequence, and imply that the extrahelical orientation of the branch-site adenosine may facilitate recognition of this base during splicing.",PMID: 11424937 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,161: Traffic  2001 Jul;2(7):476-86

A SNARE double mutant which is defective for both Golgi-to-endosome and endosome-to-vacuole trafficking replicates many of the phenotypes observed in Class C vps mutants. We show that genetic interactions exist between Class C vps alleles and alleles of the Class D vps group, which are defective in the docking and fusion of Golgi-derived vesicles at the endosome. Moreover, the Class D protein Vac1 was found to physically bind to the Class C Vps complex through a direct association with Vps11. Finally, using a random mutagenic screen, a temperature-conditional allele which shares many of the phenotypes of mutants which are selectively defective in Golgi-to-endosome trafficking was isolated (vps11-3ts).

The network is viewed as a graph whose nodes correspond to proteins. Two proteins are connected by an edge if they interact. The network resembles a random graph in that it consists of many small subnets (groups of proteins that interact with each other but do not interact with any other protein) and one large connected subnet comprising more than half of all interacting proteins. The number of interactions per protein appears to follow a power law distribution. Within approximately 200 Myr after a duplication, the products of duplicate genes become almost equally likely to (1) have common protein interaction partners and (2) be part of the same subnetwork as two proteins chosen at random from within the network. This indicates that the persistence of redundant interaction partners is the exception rather than the rule. After gene duplication, the likelihood that an interaction gets lost exceeds 2.2 x 10(-3)/Myr. New interactions are estimated to evolve at a rate that is approximately three orders of magnitude smaller.

However, few studies have directly examined dependence of chromatin remodeling in vivo on GCN5 or other acetyltransferases, and none have examined remodeling via nucleosomal activator binding sites. In this study, we have monitored chromatin perturbation via nucleosomal binding sites in the yeast episome TALS by GAL4 derivatives in GCN5(+) and gcn5Delta yeast cells. The strong activator GAL4 shows no dependence on GCN5 for remodeling TALS chromatin, whereas GAL4-estrogen receptor-VP16 shows substantial, albeit not complete, GCN5 dependence. Mini-GAL4 derivatives having weakened interactions with TATA-binding protein and TFIIB exhibit a strong dependence on GCN5 for both transcriptional activation and TALS remodeling not seen for native GAL4. These results indicate that GCN5 can contribute to chromatin remodeling at activator binding sites and that dependence on coactivator function for a given activator can vary according to the type and strength of contacts that it makes with other factors. We also found a weaker dependence for chromatin remodeling on SPT7 than on GCN5, indicating that GCN5 can function via pathways independent of the SAGA complex.

They contain two and three thioredoxin boxes (Cys-Gly-His-Cys) respectively and, like PDI, may be involved in the folding of nascent proteins. We demonstrate here that CaBP1, similar to PDI and CaBP2, can complement the lethal phenotype of the disrupted Saccharomyces cerevisiae PDI gene, provided that the natural C-terminal Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu sequence is replaced by His-Asp-Glu-Leu. Both the in vitro RNase AIII-re-activation assays and in vivo pro-(carboxypeptidase Y) processing assays using CaBP1 and CaBP2 thioredoxin (trx)-box mutants revealed that, whereas the three trx boxes in CaBP2 seem to be functionally equivalent, the first trx box of CaBP1 is significantly more active than the second trx box. Furthermore, only about 65% re-activation of denatured reduced RNase AIII could be obtained with CaBP1 or CaBP2 compared with PDI, and the yield of PDI-catalysed reactions was significantly reduced in the presence of either CaBP1 or CaBP2. In contrast with PDI, neither CaBP1 nor CaBP2 could catalyse the renaturation of denatured glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which is a redox-independent process, and neither protein had any effect on the PDI-catalysed refolding of GAPDH. Furthermore, although PDI can bind peptides via its b' domain, a property it shares with PDIp, the pancreas-specific PDI homologue, and although PDI can bind malfolded proteins such as 'scrambled' ribonuclease, no such interactions could be detected for CaBP2. We conclude that: (1) both CaBP2 and CaBP1 lack peptide-binding activity for GAPDH attributed to the C-terminal region of the a' domain of PDI; (2) CaBP2 lacks the general peptide-binding activity attributed to the b' domain of PDI; (3) interaction of CaBP2 with substrate (RNase AIII) is different from that of PDI and substrate; and (4) both CaBP2 and CaBP1 may promote oxidative folding by different kinetic pathways.",PMID: 11415439 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,165: Biochem Biophys Res Commun  2001 Jun 22;284(4):1083-9

Cdc14 activity, in turn, is regulated by a group of proteins, the mitotic exit network (MEN), which includes Lte1, Tem1, Cdc5, Cdc15, Dbf2/Dbf20, and Mob1. The direct biochemical interactions between the components of the MEN remain largely unresolved. Here, we investigate the mechanisms that underlie activation of the protein kinase Dbf2. Dbf2 kinase activity depended on Tem1, Cdc15, and Mob1 in vivo. In vitro, recombinant protein kinase Cdc15 activated recombinant Dbf2, but only when Dbf2 was bound to Mob1. Conserved phosphorylation sites Ser-374 and Thr-544 (present in the human, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster relatives of Dbf2) were required for DBF2 function in vivo, and activation of Dbf2-Mob1 by Cdc15 in vitro. Although Cdc15 phosphorylated Dbf2, Dbf2-Mob1, and Dbf2(S374A/T544A)-Mob1, the pattern of phosphate incorporation into Dbf2 was substantially altered by either the S374A T544A mutations or omission of Mob1. Thus, Cdc15 promotes the exit from mitosis by directly switching on the kinase activity of Dbf2.

The corepressor does not interact directly with DNA but is recruited to different promoters through interactions with distinct pathway-specific, DNA-binding repressor proteins. Using yeast two-hybrid and GST chromatography interaction experiments, we have determined that Sfl1, a novel repressor protein, interacts directly with Ssn6, and in vivo repression data suggest that Sfl1 inhibits transcription by recruiting Ssn6-Tup1 via a specific domain in the Sfl1 protein. Sin4 and Srb10, components of specific RNA polymerase II sub-complexes that are required for Ssn6-Tup1 repression activity, are found to be required for Sfl1 repression function. These results indicate a possible mechanism for Sfl1-mediated repression via Ssn6-Tup1 and specific subunits of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. Electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immuno-precipitation assays demonstrate that Sfl1 is present at the promoters of three Ssn6-Tup1-repressible genes; namely, FLO11, HSP26, and SUC2. Sfl1 is known to interact with Tpk2, a cAMP-dependent protein kinase that negatively regulates Sfl1 function. Consistently, we show that phosphorylation by protein kinase A inhibits Sfl1 DNA binding in vitro, and that a tpk2Delta mutation increases the levels of Sfl1 protein associated with specific promoter elements in vivo. These data indicate a possible mechanism for regulating Sfl1-mediated repression through modulation of DNA binding by cAMP-dependent protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation.

The PTR system consists of three genes, PTR1, PTR2 and PTR3.

Homologues to Ptr2p have been identified in virtually all organisms examined to date and comprise the PTR family of transport proteins. In S. cerevisiae, the expression of PTR2 is highly regulated at the cellular level by complex interactions of many genes, including PTR1, PTR3, CUP9 and SSY1. Oligopeptides, consisting of four to five amino acids, are transported by the 12-14 TMD integral membrane protein Opt1p.

In a synthetic lethality screen with YKU70, the 70-kDa subunit of the telomere-associated Yku heterodimer, we identified a new mutation in CDC13, cdc13-4, that points toward an additional regulatory function of CDC13. Although CDC13 is an essential telomerase component in vivo, no replicative senescence can be observed in cdc13-4 cells. Telomeres of cdc13-4 mutants shorten for about 150 generations until they reach a stable level. Thus, in cdc13-4 mutants, telomerase seems to be inhibited at normal telomere length but fully active at short telomeres. Furthermore, chromosome end structure remains protected in cdc13-4 mutants. Progressive telomere shortening to a steady-state level has also been described for mutants of the positive telomere length regulator TEL1. Strikingly, cdc13-4/tel1Delta double mutants display shorter telomeres than either single mutant after 125 generations and a significant amplification of Y' elements after 225 generations. Therefore CDC13, TEL1, and the Yku heterodimer seem to represent distinct pathways in telomere length maintenance. Whereas several CDC13 mutants have been reported to display elongated telomeres indicating that Cdc13p functions in negative telomere length control, we report a new mutation leading to shortened and eventually stable telomeres. Therefore we discuss a key role of CDC13 not only in telomerase recruitment but also in regulating telomerase access, which might be modulated by protein-protein interactions acting as inhibitors or activators of telomerase activity.",PMID: 11390652 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

A linear two-intermediate kinetic mechanism describes the reaction of both of these consensus strong promoters with TBP. Qualitative features common to both interactions include tightly bound TBP-DNA complexes with similar solution geometries, simultaneous DNA binding and bending, and the presence of intermediate TBP-DNA conformers at high mole fraction throughout most of the reaction and at equilibrium. Despite very similar energetic changes overall, the stepwise entropic and enthalpic compensations along the two pathways differ markedly following the initial binding/bending event.

However, their mammalian counterparts are not fully elucidated. In this study, we identified two human homologues of yeast Class C VPS genes, human VPS11 (hVPS11) and human VPS18 (hVPS18). We also characterized the subcellular localization and interactions of the protein products not only from these genes but also from the other mammalian Class C VPS homologue genes, hVPS16 and rVPS33a. The protein products of hVPS11 (hVps11) and hVPS18 (hVps18) were ubiquitously expressed in peripheral tissues, suggesting that they have a fundamental role in cellular function. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the mammalian Class C Vps proteins are predominantly associated with late endosomes/lysosomes. Immunoprecipitation and gel filtration studies showed that the mammalian Class C Vps proteins constitute a large hetero-oligomeric complex that interacts with syntaxin-7. These results indicate that like their yeast counterparts, mammalian Class C Vps proteins mediate vesicle trafficking steps in the endosome/lysosome pathway.",PMID: 11382755 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

V2 receptors heterologously expressed in yeast were unable to productively interact with the endogenous yeast G protein alpha subunit, Gpa1p, or a mutant Gpa1p subunit containing the C-terminal G alpha(q) sequence (Gq5). In contrast, the V2 receptor efficiently coupled to a Gpa1p/G alpha(s) hybrid subunit containing the C-terminal G alpha(s) sequence (Gs5), indicating that the V2 receptor retained proper G protein coupling selectivity in yeast. To gain insight into the molecular basis underlying the selectivity of V2 receptor/G protein interactions, we used receptor saturation random mutagenesis to generate a yeast library expressing mutant V2 receptors containing mutations within the second intracellular loop. A subsequent yeast genetic screen of about 30,000 mutant receptors yielded four mutant receptors that, in contrast to the wild-type receptor, showed substantial coupling to Gq5. Functional analysis of these mutant receptors, followed by more detailed site-directed mutagenesis studies, indicated that single amino acid substitutions at position Met(145) in the central portion of the second intracellular loop of the V2 receptor had pronounced effects on receptor/G protein coupling selectivity. We also observed that deletion of single amino acids N-terminal of Met(145) led to misfolded receptor proteins, whereas single amino acid deletions C-terminal of Met(145) had no effect on V2 receptor function. These findings highlight the usefulness of combining receptor random mutagenesis and yeast expression technology to study mechanisms governing receptor/G protein coupling selectivity and receptor folding."

A process model for the recombinant system was generated by linking unit operation models in an integrated fashion, with required parameter estimation and physical property determination accomplished using data from scale-down studies. This enabled the generic modeling framework established for processing of a natural enzyme from bakers' yeast to be applied. An experimental study of the same operations at the pilot scale showed that the process model gave a conservative prediction of recombinant enzyme recovery. The model successfully captured interactions leading to a low overall product yield and indicated the need for further study of precipitate breakage in the feed zone of a disc stack centrifuge in order to improve performance. The utility of scale-down units as an aid to fast model generation and the advantage of integrating computer modeling and scale-down studies to accelerate bioprocess development are highlighted.

Its known interactions with the checkpoint proteins Mec3p and Ddc1p in a PCNA-like complex indicate a sensor role in damage recognition. In a novel application of the yeast two-hybrid system and by immunoprecipitation, we show here that Rad17p is capable of increased self-interaction following DNA damage introduced by 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide, camptothecin or partial inactivation of DNA ligase I. Despite overlap of regions required for Rad17p interactions with Rad17p or Mec3p, single amino acid substitutions revealed that Rad17p x Rad17p complex formation is independent of Mec3p. E128K (rad17-1) was found to inhibit Rad17p interaction with Mec3p but not with Rad17p. On the other hand, Phe-121 is essential for Rad17p self-interaction, and its function in checkpoint arrest but not for Mec3p interaction. These differential effects indicate that Rad17p-Rad17p interaction plays a role that is independent of the Rad17p x Mec3p x Ddc1p complex, although our results are also compatible with Rad17p-mediated supercomplex formation of the Rad17p x Mec3p x Ddc1p heterotrimer in response to DNA damage."

A yeast two-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library using the PDZ domain of gamma 1- syntrophin, a recently identified brain-specific isoform, yielded overlapping clones encoding the C terminus of diacylglycerol kinase-zeta (DGK-zeta), an enzyme that converts diacylglycerol into phosphatidic acid. In biochemical assays, the C terminus of DGK-zeta, which contains a consensus PDZ-binding motif, was found to be necessary and sufficient for association with gamma 1-syntrophin. When coexpressed in HeLa cells, DGK-zeta and gamma 1-syntrophin formed a stable complex that partitioned between the cytoplasm and nucleus. DGK-zeta translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus, a process negatively regulated by protein kinase C phosphorylation. We found that DGK-zeta recruits gamma 1-syntrophin into the nucleus and that the PDZ-binding motif is required. Disrupting the interaction altered the intracellular localization of both proteins; DGK-zeta accumulated in the nucleus, whereas gamma 1-syntrophin remained in the cytoplasm. The level of endogenous syntrophins in the nucleus of HeLa cells also reflected the amount of nuclear DGK-zeta. In the brain, DGK-zeta and gamma 1-syntrophin were colocalized in cell bodies and dendrites of cerebellar Purkinjie neurons and other neuronal cell types, suggesting that their interaction is physiologically relevant. Moreover, coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments from brain extracts and cells suggest that DGK-zeta, gamma 1-syntrophin, and dystrophin form a ternary complex. Collectively, our results suggest that gamma 1-syntrophin participates in regulating the subcellular localization of DGK-zeta to ensure correct termination of diacylglycerol signaling.",PMID: 11352924 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,192: RNA  2001 Apr;7(4):565-75

The RNA subunits of each enzyme share substantial secondary structural features, and most of the protein subunits are shared between the two. One of the conserved RNA subdomains, designated P3, has previously been shown to be required for nucleolar localization. Phylogenetic sequence analysis suggests that the P3 domain interacts with one of the proteins common to RNase P and RNase MRP, a conclusion strengthened by an earlier observation that the essential domain can be interchanged between the two enzymes. To examine possible functions of the P3 domain, four conserved nucleotides in the P3 domain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNase P RNA (RPR1) were randomized to create a library of all possible sequence combinations at those positions. Selection of functional genes in vivo identified permissible variations, and viable clones that caused yeast to exhibit conditional growth phenotypes were tested for defects in RNase P RNA and tRNA biosynthesis. Under nonpermissive conditions, the mutants had reduced maturation of the RPR1 RNA precursor, an expected phenotype in cases where RNase P holoenzyme assembly is defective. This loss of RPR1 RNA maturation coincided, as expected, with a loss of pre-tRNA maturation characteristic of RNase P defects. To test whether mutations at the conserved positions inhibited interactions with a particular protein, specific binding of the individual protein subunits to the RNA subunit was tested in yeast using the three-hybrid system. Pop1p, the largest subunit shared by RNases P and MRP, bound specifically to RPR1 RNA and the isolated P3 domain, and this binding was eliminated by mutations at the conserved P3 residues. These results indicate that Pop1p interacts with the P3 domain common to RNases P and MRP, and that this interaction is critical in the maturation of RNase P holoenzyme.",PMID: 11345435 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,193: Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A  2001 May 22;98(11):6080-5

To determine the essential role of this domain we searched for mutations that require wild-type Rpa1N for viability in yeast. A mutation in RFC4, encoding a small subunit of replication factor C (RFC), was found to display allele-specific interactions with mutations in the gene encoding Rpa1 (RFA1). Mutations that map to Rpa1N and confer sensitivity to the DNA synthesis inhibitor hydroxyurea, such as rfa1-t11, are lethal in combination with rfc4-2. The rfc4-2 mutant itself is sensitive to hydroxyurea, and like rfc2 and rfc5 strains, it exhibits defects in the DNA replication block and intra-S checkpoints. RFC4 and the DNA damage checkpoint gene RAD24 were found to be epistatic with respect to DNA damage sensitivity. We show that the rfc4-2 mutant is defective in the G(1)/S DNA damage checkpoint response and that both the rfc4-2 and rfa1-t11 strains are defective in the G(2)/M DNA damage checkpoint. Thus, in addition to its essential role as part of the clamp loader in DNA replication, Rfc4 plays a role as a sensor in multiple DNA checkpoint pathways.

Here we show that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Tom40p expressed in bacteria and purified to homogeneity associates efficiently with itself. The self-association is very strong and can withstand up to 4 M urea or 1 M salt. The tight self-association does not require the N-terminal segment of Tom40p. Furthermore, purified Tom40p preferentially recognizes the targeting sequence of mitochondrial precursor proteins. Although the binding of the targeting sequence to Tom40p is inhibited by urea concentrations in excess of 1 M, it is moderately resistant to 1 M salt. Simultaneous self-assembly and precursor protein binding suggest that Tom40p contains at least two different domains mediating these processes.

Here, we examine the effects of truncation of the N-terminal region in the context of yeast TBP mutants with specific defects in DNA binding and in interactions with various proteins. For a subset of mutations that disrupt DNA binding and the response to transcriptional activators, removal of the N-terminal domain rescues their transcriptional defects. By contrast, deletion of the N-terminal region is lethal in combination with mutations on a limited surface of TBP. Although this surface is important for interactions with TFIIA and Brf1, TBP interactions with these two factors do not appear to be responsible for this dependence on the N-terminal region.

Some of these residues were suggested to act as phosphate ligands or as part of the proton cotransport path. We now show that the mutation Ser158Thr, not part of a TM helix but located near the center of the matrix loop (Ile141--Ser171) between TM helices C and D, inactivates PTP and is thus also functionally relevant. On the other side of the membrane, the single mutation Glu192Asp at the intermembrane space end of TM helix D yields a PTP with 33% wild-type activity. We constructed double mutants by adding this mutation to the six transport-inactivating mutations. Transport was detected only in those with Asp39Asn, Glu137Gln, or Ser158Thr. We conclude that TM helix D can interact with TM helices A and C and matrix loop Ile141--Ser171 and that Asp39, Glu137, and Ser158 are not essential for phosphate transport. Since our results are consistent with residues present in all 12 functionally identified members of the mitochondrial transport protein (MTP) family, they lead to a general rule that specifies MTP residue types at 7 separate locations. The conformations of all the double mutation PTPs (except that with the matrix loop Ser158Thr) are significantly different from those of the single mutation PTPs, as indicated by their very low liposome incorporation efficiency and their requirement for less detergent (Triton X-100) to stay in solution. These dramatic conformational differences also suggest an interaction between TM helices D and E.

A model of the Escherichia coli HisRS--tRNA(His) complex predicts an interaction between the prokaryotic conserved glutamine 118 of the motif 2 loop and cytosine 73. The substitution of Gln 118 in motif 2 with glutamate decreased discrimination between cytosine and uracil some 50-fold, but left overall rates of adenylation and aminoacylation unaffected. By contrast, substitutions at neighboring Glu 115 and Arg 121 affected both adenylation and aminoacylation, consistent with their predicted involvement in both half-reactions. Additional evidence for the involvement of the motif 2 loop was provided by functional analysis of a hybrid Saccharomyces cerevisiae-- E. coli HisRS possessing the 11 amino acid motif 2 loop of the yeast enzyme. Despite an overall decreased activity of nearly 1000-fold relative to the E. coli enzyme, the chimera nevertheless exhibited a modest preference for the yeast tRNA(His) over the E. coli tRNA, and preferred wild-type yeast tRNA(His) to a variant with C at the discriminator position. These experiments suggest that part of, but not all of, the specificity is provided by the motif 2 loop.

The most common system, used to date, is the two-hybrid system. Although proven very powerful, the two-hybrid system exhibits several inherent problems and limitations. Recently, two alternative systems have been described that take advantage of the fact that localization of signal transduction effectors to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane is absolutely necessary for yeast viability. These effectors can either be the Ras guanyl nucleotide exchange factor or Ras itself. The yeast strain used in both systems is a temperature-sensitive mutant in the yeast Ras guanyl nucleotide exchange factor, CDC25. Membrane localization of these effectors is achieved via protein +/- protein interaction. Each system can be used to test interaction between known protein pairs, as well as for isolation of novel protein interactions.

Its C-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans. However, the cellular function of UBA domains is not completely understood. Recently, RAD23 and DDI1, both DNA damage-inducible genes encoding proteins with UBA domains, were implicated genetically in Pds1-dependent mitotic control in yeast. The UBA domains of RAD23 and DDI1 are required for these interactions. Timely degradation of Pds1 via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway allows anaphase onset and is crucial for chromosome maintenance. Here, we show that Rad23 and Ddi1 interact directly with ubiquitin and that this interaction is dependent on their UBA domains, providing a possible mechanism for UBA-dependent cell cycle control. Moreover, we show that a hydrophobic surface on the UBA domain, which from structural work had been predicted to be a protein-protein interaction interface, is indeed required for ubiquitin binding. By demonstrating that UBA domains interact with ubiquitin, we have provided the first indication of a cellular function for the UBA domain.",PMID: 11323716 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,

Yeast ORC binds specifically to origins of replication and serves as a platform for the assembly of additional initiation factors, such as Cdc6 and the Mcm proteins. Human homologues of all six ORC subunits have been identified by sequence similarity to their yeast counterparts, but little is known about the biochemical characteristics of human ORC (HsORC). We have extracted HsORC from HeLa cell chromatin and probed its subunit composition using specific antibodies. The endogenous HsORC, identified in these experiments, contained homologues of Orc1-Orc5 but lacked a putative homologue of Orc6. By expressing HsORC subunits in insect cells using the baculovirus system, we were able to identify a complex containing all six subunits. To explore the subunit-subunit interactions that are required for the assembly of HsORC, we carried out extensive co-immunoprecipitation experiments with recombinant ORC subunits expressed in different combinations. These studies revealed the following binary interactions: HsOrc2-HsOrc3, HsOrc2-HsOrc4, HsOrc3-HsOrc4, HsOrc2-HsOrc6, and HsOrc3-HsOrc6. HsOrc5 did not form stable binary complexes with any other HsORC subunit but interacted with sub-complexes containing any two of subunits HsOrc2, HsOrc3, or HsOrc4. Complex formation by HsOrc1 required the presence of HsOrc2, HsOrc3, HsOrc4, and HsOrc5 subunits. These results suggest that the subunits HsOrc2, HsOrc3, and HsOrc4 form a core upon which the ordered assembly of HsOrc5 and HsOrc1 takes place. The characterization of HsORC should facilitate the identification of human origins of DNA replication.",PMID: 11323433 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies of GAL4-dd revealed an elongated dimer structure with C(2) symmetry containing three helices that mediate dimerization via coiled-coil contacts. The two loops between the three coiled coils form mobile bulges causing a variation of twist angles between the helix pairs.

We have exploited variable expression of human p53 in yeast to identify mutants with novel phenotypes that would correspond to altered promoter selectivity and affinity. The p53 cDNA regions coding for the DNA binding and tetramerization domains were subjected to random PCR mutagenesis and were cloned directly by recombination in yeast into a vector with a GAL1 promoter whose level of expression could be easily varied. p53 variants exhibiting higher than wild type levels of transactivation (supertrans) for the RGC responsive element were identified at low level of p53 protein expression. All the p53 mutants obtained with this screen were located in the DNA binding domain. Two out of 17 supertrans mutants have been found in tumors. Six mutations were in the L1 loop region between amino acids 115 and 124. The transactivation potential of a panel of supertrans p53 mutants on different promoters was evaluated using the p53 responsive elements, RGC, PIG3, p21 and bax. Although all mutants retained some activity with all promoters, we found different patterns of induction based on strength and promoter specificity. In particular none of the mutants was supertrans for the p21 responsive element. Interestingly, further analysis in yeast showed that the transactivation function could be retained even in the presence of dominant-negative p53 tumor mutations that could inhibit wild type p53. Five mutants were also characterized in human cells in terms of growth suppression and transactivation of various promoters. These novel supertrans p53 mutants may be useful in studies aimed at dissecting p53 downstream pathways, understanding specific interactions between p53 and the DNA, and could replace wild type p53 in cancer gene therapy protocols.

Coimmunoprecipitation experiments using epitope-tagged 5LO and CLP proteins transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells revealed the presence of CLP in 5LO immunoprecipitates.

Site-directed mutagenesis suggested an important role for lysine 131 of CLP in mediating 5LO binding. In view of the ability of CLP to bind 5LO and filamentous actin (F-actin), we determined whether CLP could physically link 5LO to actin filaments. However, no F-actin-CLP.5LO ternary complex was observed. In contrast, 5LO appeared to compete with F-actin for the binding of CLP. Moreover, 5LO was found to interfere with actin polymerization.

Thermozymes and their applications: a review of recent literature and patents.,"Bruins ME, Janssen AE, Boom RM.","Department of Food Technology and Nutritional Sciences, Wageningen University, The Netherlands. marieke.bruins@algemeen.pk.wau.nl","Enzymes from thermophilic microorganisms, thermozymes, have unique characteristics such as temperature, chemical, and pH stability. They can be used in several industrial processes, in which they replace mesophilic enzymes or chemicals. Thermozymes are often used when the enzymatic process is compatible with existing (high-temperature) process conditions. The main advantages of performing processes at higher temperatures are reduced risk of microbial contamination, lower viscosity, improved transfer rates, and improved solubility of substrates. However, cofactors, substrates, or products might be unstable or other side reactions may occur. Recent developments show that thermophiles are a good source of novel catalysts that are of great industrial interest. Thermostable polymer-degrading enzymes such as amylases, pullulanases, xylanases, proteases, and cellulases are expected to play an important role in food, chemical, pharmaceutical, paper, pulp, and waste-treatment industries. Considerable research efforts have been made to better understand the stability of thermozymes. There are no major conformational differences with mesophilic enzymes, and a small number of extra salt bridges, hydrophobic interactions, or hydrogen bounds seem to confer the extra degree of stabilization. Currently, overexpression of thermozymes in standard Escherichia coli allows the production of much larger quantities of enzymes, which are easy to purify by heat treatment. With wider availability and lower cost, thermophilic enzymes will see more application in industry.","Publication Types: Review Review, Tutorial",PMID: 11297390 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

They mediate adherens junction assembly, thus determining tissue architecture, and also transduce Wnt/Wingless intercellular signals, which regulate embryonic cell fates and, if inappropriately activated, contribute to tumorigenesis. To learn more about Armadillo/beta-catenin's scaffolding function, we examined in detail its interaction with one of its protein targets, cadherin. We utilized two assay systems: the yeast two-hybrid system to study cadherin binding in the absence of Armadillo/beta-catenin's other protein partners, and mammalian cells where interactions were assessed in their presence. We found that segments of the cadherin cytoplasmic tail as small as 23 amino acids bind Armadillo or beta-catenin in yeast, whereas a slightly longer region is required for binding in mammalian cells. We used mutagenesis to identify critical amino acids required for cadherin interaction with Armadillo/beta-catenin. Expression of such short cadherin sequences in mammalian cells did not affect adherens junctions but effectively inhibited beta-catenin-mediated signaling. This suggests that the interaction between beta-catenin and T cell factor family transcription factors is a sensitive target for disruption, making the use of analogues of these cadherin derivatives a potentially useful means to suppress tumor progression.",PMID: 11294915 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

HSF binds DNA as a trimer, and additional trimers can bind DNA co-operatively. Unlike other winged helix-turn-helix proteins, HSF's wing does not appear to contact DNA, as based on a previously solved crystal structure. Instead, the structure implies that the wing is involved in protein-protein interactions, possibly within a trimer or between adjacent trimers. To understand the function of the wing in the HSF DNA-binding domain, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain was created that expresses a wingless HSF protein. This strain grows normally at 30 degrees C, but shows a decrease in reporter gene expression during constitutive and heat-shocked conditions. Removal of the wing does not affect the stability or trimeric nature of a protein fragment containing the DNA-binding and trimerization domains. Removal of the wing does result in a decrease in DNA-binding affinity. This defect was mainly observed in the ability to form the first trimer-bound complex, as the formation of larger complexes is unaffected by the deletion. Our results suggest that the wing is not involved in the highly co-operative nature of HSF binding, but may be important in stabilizing the first trimer bound to DNA.",PMID: 11292844 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

Rad54 protein and Rad54-K341R, a mutant protein defective in the Walker A box ATP-binding fold, were fused to glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and purified to near homogeneity.

Rad54 protein stimulated Rad51/Rpa-mediated DNA strand exchange by specifically increasing the kinetics of joint molecule formation. This stimulation was accompanied by a concurrent increase in the formation of heteroduplex DNA. Our results suggest that Rad54 protein interacts specifically with established Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments before homology search on the duplex DNA and heteroduplex DNA formation.

Interactions were generally detectable with kinase domains of both Class I and Class II SRKs. Chimeric constructs were made between the SRK910 kinase domain and the non-interacting Arabidopsis RLK5 kinase domain. Only one chimeric construct, SRR2, interacted with THL1 and THL2, while none of the chimeras were able to interact with ARC1. SRR2 is largely made up of RLK5 kinase domain with the N-terminal end being derived from the SRK910 kinase domain and was the only chimeric construct that retained kinase activity. Deletion or substitution of a conserved cysteine at the N-terminal end of the SRK910 kinase domain resulted in loss of interaction with THL1 and THL2, while the addition of this cysteine to a related receptor kinase, SFR1, conferred the ability to interact with the thioredoxin h proteins. In addition, substitution of the cysteines in the THL1 active site abolished the interaction. Lastly, the two Arabidopsis thioredoxin h clones most closely related to THL1 and THL2 were found to interact with the SRK kinase domains. Thus, the nature of the interaction of the thioredoxin h clones with SRK involves the reducing activity of these proteins and is restricted to the class of thioredoxin h proteins which have the variant CPPC active site.",PMID: 11292081 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

Because the U5 snRNP plays a central role in pre-mRNA splicing, we undertook exhaustive two-hybrid screening with Brr2p, Prp8p, and other U5 snRNP-associated proteins. DExH-box protein Brr2p interacted specifically with five splicing factors: Prp8p, DEAH-box protein Prp16p, U1 snRNP protein Snp1p, second-step factor Slu7p, and U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP protein Snu66p, which is required for splicing at low temperatures. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed direct or indirect interactions of Prp16p, Prp8p, Snu66p, and Snp1p with Brr2p and led us to propose that Brr2p mediates the recruitment of Prp16p to the spliceosome. We provide evidence that the prp8-1 allele disrupts an interaction with Brr2p, and we propose that Prp8p modulates U4/U6 snRNA duplex unwinding through another interaction with Brr2p. The interactions of Brr2p with a wide range of proteins suggest a particular function for the C-terminal half, bringing forward the hypothesis that, apart from U4/U6 duplex unwinding, Brr2p promotes other RNA rearrangements, acting synergistically with other spliceosomal proteins, including the structurally related Prp2p and Prp16p.

Our discovery of the Drosophila ORC complex concentrated in the centric heterochromatin of mitotic cells in the early embryo and its interactions with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP-1) lead us to speculate that ORC may play some general role in chromosomal folding. To explore the role of ORC in chromosomal condensation, we have identified a mutant of subunit 5 of the Drosophila melanogaster origin recognition complex (Orc5) and have characterized the phenotypes of both the Orc5 and the previously identified Orc2 mutant, k43. Both Orc mutants died at late larval stages and surprisingly, despite a reduced number of S-phase cells, an increased fraction of cells were also detected in mitosis. For this latter population of cells, Orc mutants arrest in a defective metaphase with shorter and thicker chromosomes that fail to align at the metaphase plate within a poorly assembled mitotic spindle. In addition, sister chromatid cohesion was frequently lost. PCNA and MCM4 mutants had similar phenotypes to Orc mutants. We propose that DNA replication defects trigger the mitotic arrest, due to the fact that frequent fragmentation was observed. Thus, cells have a mitotic checkpoint that senses chromosome integrity.

Both exhibit genetic and physical ties to replication fork constituents. We find that absence of either CTF4 or CTF18 causes sister chromatid cohesion failure and leads to a preanaphase accumulation of cells that depends on the spindle assembly checkpoint. The physical and genetic interactions between CTF4, CTF18, and core components of replication fork complexes observed in this study and others suggest that both gene products act in association with the replication fork to facilitate sister chromatid cohesion. We find that Ctf18p, an RFC1-like protein, directly interacts with Rfc2p, Rfc3p, Rfc4p, and Rfc5p. However, Ctf18p is not a component of biochemically purified proliferating cell nuclear antigen loading RF-C, suggesting the presence of a discrete complex containing Ctf18p, Rfc2p, Rfc3p, Rfc4p, and Rfc5p. Recent identification and characterization of the budding yeast polymerase kappa, encoded by TRF4, strongly supports a hypothesis that the DNA replication machinery is required for proper sister chromatid cohesion. Analogous to the polymerase switching role of the bacterial and human RF-C complexes, we propose that budding yeast RF-C(CTF18) may be involved in a polymerase switch event that facilities sister chromatid cohesion.

In addition, CRANC channels in inside-out plasma membrane patches are directly activated upon exposure of their cytoplasmic side to highly purified CIF preparations. Furthermore, CRANC channels are also directly activated by diacylglycerol.

The small G protein Tem1p is critical in promoting mitotic exit and is concentrated at the spindle pole destined for the bud. The presumed nucleotide exchange factor for Tem1p, Lte1p, is concentrated in the bud. These findings suggested the hypothesis that movement of the spindle pole through the neck allows Tem1p to interact with Lte1p, promoting GTP loading of Tem1p and mitotic exit. However, we report that deletion of LTE1 had little effect on the timing of mitotic exit. We also examined several mutants in which some cells inappropriately exit mitosis even though the spindle is within the mother. In some of these cells, the spindle pole body did not interact with the bud or the neck before mitotic exit. Thus, some alternative mechanism must exist to coordinate mitotic exit with spindle position. In both wild-type and mutant cells, mitotic exit was preceded by loss of cytoplasmic microtubules from the neck. Thus, the spindle position checkpoint may monitor such interactions.",PMID: 11285282 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

We previously developed a system to examine two-hybrid interactions in all possible combinations between the approximately 6,000 proteins of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we have completed the comprehensive analysis using this system to identify 4,549 two-hybrid interactions among 3,278 proteins.

Cumulative connection of these binary interactions generates a single huge network linking the vast majority of the proteins. Bioinformatics-aided selection of biologically relevant interactions highlights various intriguing subnetworks. They include, for instance, the one that had successfully foreseen the involvement of a novel protein in spindle pole body function as well as the one that may uncover a hitherto unidentified multiprotein complex potentially participating in the process of vesicular transport. Our data would thus significantly expand and improve the protein interaction map for the exploration of genome functions that eventually leads to thorough understanding of the cell as a molecular system."

We have examined whether the nuclear cAMP-dependent protein kinase-anchoring protein AKAP95 contains specific signals for targeting to the subnuclear compartment and for interaction with other proteins. AKAP95 was expressed in mammalian cells and found to localize exclusively to the nuclear matrix. Mutational analysis was used to identify determinants for nuclear localization and nuclear matrix targeting of AKAP95. These sites were found to be distinct from previously identified DNA and protein kinase A binding domains. The nuclear matrix-targeting site is unique but conserved among members of the AKAP95 family. Direct binding of AKAP95 to isolated nuclear matrix was demonstrated in situ and found to be dependent on the nuclear matrix-targeting site. Moreover, Far Western blot analysis identified at least three AKAP95-binding proteins in nuclear matrix isolated from rat brain. Yeast two-hybrid cloning identified one binding partner as p68 RNA helicase. The helicase and AKAP95 co-localized in the nuclear matrix of mammalian cells, associated in vitro, and were precipitated as a complex from solubilized cell extracts. The results define novel protein-protein interactions among nuclear matrix proteins and suggest a potential role of AKAP95 as a scaffold for coordinating assembly of hormonally responsive transcription complexes."

We used structure-guided alanine scanning to identify 6 side chains within the triphosphate tunnel that are essential for phosphohydrolase activity in vitro and in vivo: Arg393, Glu433, Arg458, Arg469, Asp471 and Thr473. Alanine substitutions at two positions, Asp377 and Lys409, resulted in partial catalytic defects and a thermosensitive growth phenotype. Structure-function relationships were clarified by introducing conservative substitutions. Five residues were found to be nonessential: Lys309, Ser395, Asp397, Lys427 Asn431, and Lys474. The present findings, together with earlier mutational analyses, reveal an unusually complex active site in which 15 individual side chains in the tunnel cavity are important for catalysis, and each of the 8 strands of the beta barrel contributes at least one functional constituent. The active site residues fall into three classes: (i) those that participate directly in catalysis via coordination of the gamma phosphate or the metal; (ii) those that make critical water-mediated contacts with the gamma phosphate or the metal; and (iii) those that function indirectly via interactions with other essential side chains or by stabilization of the tunnel structure."

The active site of Cet1 resides within a topologically closed hydrophilic beta-barrel (the triphosphate tunnel) that is supported by a globular hydrophobic core. The homodimeric quaternary structure of Cet1 is formed by a network of contacts between the partner protomers. By studying the effects of alanine-cluster mutations, we highlight the contributions of two separate facets of the crystallographic dimer interface to Cet1 function in vivo. One essential facet of the interface entails hydrophobic cross-dimer interactions of Cys(330) and Val(331) and a cross-dimer hydrogen bond of Asp(280) with the backbone amide of Gln(329). The second functionally relevant dimer interface involves hydrophobic side-chain interactions of Phe(272) and Leu(273). Ala-cluster mutations involving these residues elicited lethal or severe temperature-sensitive phenotypes that were suppressed completely by fusion of the mutated triphosphatases to the guanylyltransferase domain of mammalian capping enzyme. The recombinant D279A-D280A and F272A-L273A proteins retained phosphohydrolase activity but sedimented as monomers. These results indicate that a disruption of the dimer interface is uniquely deleterious when the yeast RNA triphosphatase must function in concert with the endogenous yeast guanylyltransferase. We also identify key residue pairs in the hydrophobic core of the Cet1 protomer that support the active site tunnel and stabilize the triphosphatase in vivo."

Many transcription factors are controlled by cis-acting autoinhibitory modules that are thought to act by blocking promiscuous DNA binding in the absence of appropriate regulatory cues. Here, we have investigated the determinants and regulation of the autoinhibitory mechanism employed by the ETS-domain transcription factor, PEA3. DNA binding is inhibited by a module composed of a combination of two short motifs located on either side of the ETS DNA-binding domain. A second type of protein, Ids, can act in trans to mimic the effect of these cis-acting inhibitory motifs and reduce DNA binding by PEA3. By using a one-hybrid screen, we identified the basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper transcription factor USF-1 as an interaction partner for PEA3. PEA3 and USF-1 form DNA complexes in a cooperative manner. Moreover, the formation of ternary PEA3.USF-1.DNA complexes requires parts of the same motifs in PEA3 that form the autoinhibitory module. Thus the binding of USF-1 to PEA3 acts as a switch that modifies the autoinhibitory motifs in PEA3 to first relieve their inhibitory action, and second, promote ternary nucleoprotein complex assembly."

J., and Gallwitz, D. (1993) Nature 361, 736-739). We have investigated the kinetic parameters of Gyp6p/Ypt6p interactions and find that Gyp6p accelerates the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ypt6p (0.0002 min(-1)) by a factor of 5 x 10(6) and that they have a very low affinity for its preferred substrate (K(m) = 592 micrometer). Substitution with alanine of several arginines, which Gyp6p shares with other GYP family members, resulted in significant inhibition of GAP activity. Replacement of arginine-155 with either alanine or lysine abolished its GAP activity, indicating a direct involvement of this strictly conserved arginine in catalysis. Physical interaction of the catalytically inactive Gyp6(R155A) mutant GAP with Ypt6 wild-type and Ypt6 mutant proteins could be demonstrated with the two-hybrid system. Short N-terminal and C-terminal truncations of Gyp6p resulted in a complete loss of GAP activity and Ypt6p binding, showing that in contrast to two other Gyp proteins studied previously, most of the 458 amino acid-long Gyp6p sequence is required to form a three-dimensional structure that allows substrate binding and catalysis."

In this work, stalk segments S4 and S5 of the yeast H(+)-ATPase were examined for helical character, optimal length, and segment orientation by a combination of proline substitution, insertion/deletion mutagenesis, and second-site suppressor analyses. The substitution of various residues for helix-disrupting proline in both S4 (L353P,L353G; A354P; and G371P) and S5 (D676P and I684P) resulted in highly defective or inactive enzymes supporting the importance of helical character and/or the maintenance of essential interactions. The contiguous helical nature of transmembrane segment M5 and stalk element S5 was explored and found to be favorable, although not essential. The deletion or addition of one or more amino acids at positions Ala(354) in S4 and Asp(676) in S5, which were intended to either rotate helical faces or extend/reduce the length of helical segments, resulted in enzyme destabilization that abolished most enzyme assembly. Second-site suppressor mutations were obtained to primary site mutations G371A (S4) and D676G (S5) and were analyzed with a molecular structure model of the H(+)-ATPase. Primary site mutations were predicted to alter the site of phosphorylation either directly or indirectly. The suppressor mutations either directly changed packing around the primary site or altered the environment of the site of phosphorylation. Overall, these data support the view that stalk segments S4 and S5 of the H(+)-ATPase are helical elements that are optimized for length and interactions with other stalk elements and can influence the phosphorylation domain."

Here we describe the isolation of mutants of the J-domain protein, Jac1p, using the same screen. Mutant jac1 alleles predicted to encode severely truncated proteins (lacking 70 or 152 amino acids) were associated with phenotypes strikingly similar to the phenotypes of ssq1 mutants. These phenotypes include activation of the high affinity cellular iron uptake system and iron accumulation in mitochondria. In contrast to iron accumulation, Fe-S proteins of mitochondria were specifically deficient. In jac1 mutants, like in ssq1 mutants, processing of the Yfh1p precursor protein from intermediate to mature forms was delayed. In the genetic backgrounds used in this study, jac1 null mutants were found to be viable, permitting analysis of genetic interactions. The Deltajac1 Deltassq1 double mutant was more severely compromised for growth than either single mutant, suggesting a synthetic or additive effect of these mutations. Overexpression of Jac1p partially suppressed ssq1 slow growth and vice versa. Similar mitochondrial localization and similar mutant phenotypes suggest that Ssq1p and Jac1p are functional partners in iron homeostasis."

Cell wall attachment of Aga2p is mediated through two disulfide bonds to Aga1p (Cappellaro, C., Baldermann, C., Rachel, R., and Tanner, W. (1994) EMBO J. 13, 4737-4744). We report here that purified Aga2p was unstable and had low molar specific activity relative to its receptor alpha-agglutinin. Aga2p co-expressed with a 149-residue fragment of Aga1p formed a disulfide-linked complex with specific activity 43-fold higher than Aga2p expressed alone. Circular dichroism of the complex revealed a mixed alpha/beta structure, whereas Aga2p alone had no periodic secondary structure. A 30-residue Cys-rich Aga1p fragment was partially active in stabilization of Aga2p activity. Mutation of either or both Aga2p cysteine residues eliminated stabilization of Aga2p. Thus the roles of Aga1p include both cell wall anchorage and cysteine-dependent conformational restriction of the binding subunit Aga2p. Mutagenesis of AGA2 identified only C-terminal residues of Aga2p as being essential for binding activity. Aga2p residues 45-72 are similar to sequences in soybean Nod genes, and include residues implicated in interactions with both Aga1p (including Cys(68)) and alpha-agglutinin."

A search for suppressors of a mutation that causes a loss of interaction (ftsZ(D373G)) identified eight different changes at two residues within this sequence. In vitro, wild type FtsZ interacted with ZipA with a high affinity in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas FtsZ(D373G) failed to interact. Two mutant proteins examined restored this interaction significantly. In vivo, the alleles tested are significantly more toxic than the wild type ftsZ and cannot complement a deletion. We have shown that a fusion, which encodes the last 70 residues of FtsZ in the two-hybrid system, is sufficient for the interaction with FtsA and ZipA. However, when the wild type sequence is compared with one that encodes FtsZ(D373G), no interaction was seen with either protein. Mutations surrounding Asp-373 differentially affected the interactions of FtsZ with ZipA and FtsA, indicating that these proteins bind the C terminus of FtsZ differently."

The heterodimer of TB-RBP and Trax inhibits TB-RBP binding to RNA, but enhances TB-RBP binding to specific single stranded DNA sequences. The in vitro interactions between TB-RBP and Trax are confirmed by similar interactions in the yeast two-hybrid system. Cell fractionation and confocal microscope studies reveal that Trax is predominantly cytoplasmic. In contrast, TB-RBP is present in both the nuclei and cytoplasm of transfected cells and uses a highly conserved nuclear export signal to exit nuclei. In addition to a leucine zipper, two basic domains in TB-RBP are essential for RNA binding, but only one of these domains is needed for DNA binding. Trax restores DNA binding to TB-RBP containing an altered form of this domain. These data suggest that Trax-TB.RBP interactions modulate the DNA- and RNA-binding activity of TB-RBP."

In this study we characterized the dimerization of S100A4 (also named Mts1) in vitro and in vivo. Analytical ultracentrifugation revealed that apoS100A4 was present in solution as a mixture of monomers and dimers in a rapidly reversible equilibrium (K(d) = 4 +/- 2 microm). The binding of calcium promoted dimerization. Replacement of Tyr-75 by Phe resulted in the stabilization of the dimer. Helix IV is known to form the major part of the dimerization interface in homologous S100 proteins. By using the yeast two-hybrid system we showed that only a few residues of helix IV, namely Phe-72, Tyr-75, Phe-78, and Leu-79, are essential for dimerization in vivo. A homology model demonstrated that these residues form a hydrophobic cluster on helix IV. Their role is to stabilize the structure of individual subunits rather than provide specific interactions across the dimerization surface. Our mutation data showed that the specificity at the dimerization surface is not particularly stringent, which is consistent with recent data indicating that S100 proteins can form heterodimers."

One such SNAP-binding protein, termed Gaf-1 (gamma-SNAP associate factor-1) specifically binds gamma- but not alpha-SNAP. The full-length Gaf-1 (75 kDa) is ubiquitously expressed and is found stoichiometrically associated with gamma-SNAP in cellular extracts. This binding is distinct from other SNAP interactions since no alpha-SNAP or NSF coprecipitated with Gaf-1. Subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence analysis show that Gaf-1 is peripherally associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane. Only a fraction of gamma-SNAP was mitochondrial with the balance being either cytosolic or associated with other membrane fractions. GFP-gamma-SNAP and the C-terminal domain of Gaf-1 both show a reticular distribution in HEK-293 cells. This reticular structure colocalizes with Gaf-1 and mitochondria as well as with microtubules but not with other cytoskeletal elements.

The physical interactions between protein domains are fundamental to the workings of a cell: in multi-domain polypeptide chains, in multi-subunit proteins and in transient complexes between proteins that also exist independently. To study the large-scale patterns and evolution of interactions between protein domains, we view interactions between protein domains in terms of the interactions between structural families of evolutionarily related domains. This allows us to classify 8151 interactions between individual domains in the Protein Data Bank and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in terms of 664 types of interactions, between protein families. At least 51 interactions do not occur in the Protein Data Bank and can only be derived from the yeast data. The map of interactions between protein families has the form of a scale-free network, meaning that most protein families only interact with one or two other families, while a few families are extremely versatile in their interactions and are connected to many families. We observe that almost half of all known families engage in interactions with domains from their own family. We also see that the repertoires of interactions of domains within and between polypeptide chains overlap mostly for two specific types of protein families: enzymes and same-family interactions. This suggests that different types of protein interaction repertoires exist for structural, functional and regulatory reasons. Copyright 12001 Academic Press."

One class focuses on excluded volume effects, while the other focuses on binding between the protein and the osmolyte. To better understand protein--smolyte interactions, we have conducted sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation experiments using ferricytochrome c as a model protein. From these experiments, we determined the second virial coefficients for a series of osmolytes. We have interpreted the second virial coefficient as a measure of both excluded volume and protein--osmolyte binding.

We have now tested all known mammalian Groucho family members for their ability to interact specifically with individual Tcf/Lef family members. Transcriptional activation by any Tcf could be repressed by Grg-1, Grg-2/TLE-2, Grg-3 and Grg-4 in a reporter assay. Specific interactions between Tcf and Grg proteins may be achieved in vivo by tissue- or cell type-limited expression. To address this, we determined the expression of all Tcf and Grg/TLE family members in a panel of cell lines. Within any cell line, several Tcfs and TLEs are co-expressed. Thus, redundancy in Tcf/Grg interactions appears to be the rule. The 'long' Groucho family members containing five domains are repressors of Tcf-mediated transactivation, whereas Grg-5, which only contains the first two domains, acts as a de-repressor. As previously shown for DROSOPHILA: Groucho, we show that long Grg proteins interact with histone deacetylase-1. Although Grg-5 contains the GP homology domain that mediates HDAC binding in long Grg proteins, Grg-5 fails to bind this co-repressor, explaining how it can de-repress transcription."

The trained network was able to successfully identify the wild-type binding sites of EGR and MIG protein families.

We report that the GIP complex is a highly stable complex with an unusual resistance to urea and alkaline pH. Under mild conditions for mitochondrial lysis, the receptor Tom20, but not Tom70, is quantitatively associated with the GIP complex, forming a 500K to 600K TOM complex. A preprotein, stably arrested in the GIP complex, is released by urea but not high salt, indicating that ionic interactions are not essential for keeping the preprotein in the GIP complex. Under more stringent detergent conditions, however, Tom20 and all three small Tom proteins are released, while the preprotein remains in the GIP complex. Moreover, purified outer membrane vesicles devoid of translocase components of the intermembrane space and inner membrane efficiently accumulate the preprotein in the GIP complex. Together, Tom40 and Tom22 thus represent the functional core unit that stably holds accumulated preproteins. The GIP complex isolated from outer membranes exhibits characteristic TOM channel activity with two coupled conductance states, each corresponding to the activity of purified Tom40, suggesting that the complex contains two simultaneously active and coupled channel pores."

Many interactions between these components have been detected, using different physical methods, in human cells and for the homologous factors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Several human nucleotide excision repair (NER) complexes, including a high-molecular-mass repairosome complex, have been proposed. However, there have been no measurements of activity of any mammalian NER protein complex isolated under native conditions. In order to assess relative strengths of interactions between NER factors, we captured TFIIH from cell extracts with an anti-cdk7 antibody, retaining TFIIH in active form attached to magnetic beads. Coimmunoprecipitation of other NER proteins was then monitored functionally in a reconstituted repair system with purified proteins. We found that all detectable TFIIH in gently prepared human cell extracts was present in the intact nine-subunit form. There was no evidence for a repair complex that contained all of the NER components. At low ionic strength TFIIH could associate with functional amounts of each NER factor except RPA. At physiological ionic strength, TFIIH associated with significant amounts of XPC-HR23B and XPG but not other repair factors. The strongest interaction was between TFIIH and XPC-HR23B, indicating a coupled role of these proteins in early steps of repair. A panel of antibodies was used to estimate that there are on the order of 10(5) molecules of each core NER factor per HeLa cell."

Human SP-A and SP-D and rat SP-D bind to Aspergillus fumigatus conidia, but the ligand remains unidentified. To identify a fungal ligand for SP-A and/or SP-D, we examined the interactions of the proteins with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SP-D but not SP-A bound yeast cells, and EDTA inhibited the binding. SP-D also aggregated yeast cells and isolated yeast cell walls. Treating yeast cells to remove cell wall mannoprotein did not reduce SP-D binding, and SP-D failed to aggregate chitin. However, SP-D aggregated yeast glucan before and after treatment with a beta(1-->3)-glucanase, suggesting a specific interaction between the collectin and beta(1-->6)-glucan. In support of this idea, SP-D-induced yeast aggregation was strongly inhibited by pustulan [a beta(1-->6)-linked glucose homopolymer] but was not inhibited by laminarin [a beta(1-->3)-linked glucose homopolymer]. Additionally, pustulan but not laminarin strongly inhibited SP-D binding to A. fumigatus. The pustulan concentration for 50% inhibition of SP-D binding to A. fumigatus is 1.0 +/- 0.3 microM glucose equivalents. Finally, SP-D showed reduced binding to the beta(1-->6)-glucan-deficient kre6 yeast mutant. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that beta(1-->6)-glucan is an important fungal ligand for SP-D and that glycosidic bond patterns alone can determine if an extended carbohydrate polymer is recognized by SP-D."

In this report, we have assessed the contributions of some components of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription machinery to UV resistance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Deletion of the gene encoding the Pol II elongation factor TFIIS (SII) resulted in enhanced UV sensitivity, but only in the absence of global genome repair dependent on the RAD7 and RAD16 genes, a result seen previously with deletions of RAD26 and RAD28, yeast homologs of the human Cockayne syndrome genes CSB and CSA, respectively. A RAD7/16-dependent reduction in survival after UV irradiation was also seen in the presence of mutations in RNA Pol II that confer a defect in its response to SII, as well as with other mutations which reside in regions of the largest subunit of Pol II not involved in SII interactions. Indeed, an increase in UV sensitivity was achieved by simply decreasing the steadystate level of RNA Pol II. Truncation of the C-terminal domain and other RNA Pol II mutations conferred sensitivity to the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea and induction of RNR1 and RNR2 mRNAs after UV irradiation was attenuated in these mutant cells. That UV sensitivity can be a consequence of mutations in the RNA Pol II machinery in yeast cells suggests that alterations in transcriptional programs could underlie some of the pathophysiological defects seen in the human disease Cockayne syndrome."

In an inversion of emphasis, the increasing availability of such information now provides a master plan with the potential to specify the most promising directions for biological investigations (i.e., by directing the physiological validation of predicted critical protein-protein interactions). Recent derivatives of the two-hybrid system enable the targeting of such key interactions by facilitating the identification of essential amino acids conferring protein interaction specificity and of small molecules that selectively disrupt defined interaction pairs. Finally, the creation of mammalian expression systems based on two-hybrid principles became a new tool to create and probe novel biological systems. Taken in sum, this trajectory emphasizes the point that the creation of tools and the evolution of the idea of what is an interesting biological problem are in intimate dialogue."

While the K domain was essential for protein-protein interaction, a region preceded by the K domain augmented this interaction.

Despite the preclinical success of TOP-53, several questions remain regarding its cytotoxic mechanism. Therefore, this study characterized the basis for drug action. Results indicate that topoisomerase II is the primary cytotoxic target for TOP-53. Furthermore, the drug kills cells by acting as a topoisomerase II poison. TOP-53 exhibits a DNA cleavage site specificity that is identical to that of etoposide. Like its parent compound, the drug increases the number of enzyme-mediated DNA breaks by interfering with the DNA religation activity of the enzyme. TOP-53 is considerably more efficient than etoposide at enhancing topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage and exhibits high activity against human topoisomerase IIalpha and IIbeta in vitro and in cultured cells. Therefore, at least in part, the enhanced cytotoxic activity of TOP-53 can be attributed to an enhanced activity against topoisomerase II. Finally, TOP-53 displays nearly wild-type activity against a mutant yeast type II enzyme that is highly resistant to etoposide. This finding suggests that TOP-53 can retain activity against systems that have developed resistance to etoposide, and indicates that substituents on the etoposide C-ring are important for topoisomerase II-drug interactions.",PMID: 11170388 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,

Previous work showed that Mcm10p interacts with the Mcm2-7 protein complex that may be functioning as the replication-licensing factor. In addition, Mcm10p is required during origin activation and disassembly of the prereplicative complex, which allows smooth passage of replication forks. RESULTS: We show that an mcm10 mutation causes a slow progression of DNA synthesis and a loss of chromosome integrity during the S phase and prevents entry into mitosis, despite apparent completion of chromosomal DNA replication at nonpermissive temperatures. Furthermore, Mcm10p interacts genetically with the origin recognition complex (ORC) and various replication elongation factors, including a subunit of DNA polymerases epsilon and delta. Mcm10p is an abundant protein (approximately 4 x 10(4) copies per haploid cell) that is almost exclusively localized in the chromatin and/or nuclear matrix fractions during all phases of the cell cycle. When it is visualized by the chromosome-spreading method followed by immunostaining, Mcm10p forms punctate foci on chromatin throughout the cell cycle and these foci mostly overlap with those of Orc1p, a component of ORC. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Mcm10p, like the Mcm2-7 proteins, is a critical component of the prereplication chromatin and acts together with ORC during the initiation of chromosomal DNA replication; in addition, Mcm10p plays an important role during the elongation of DNA replication.",PMID: 11168584 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,

Here we propose AFM as a reliable and easy technique for identifying protein interaction sites in long DNA molecules like gene promoters. We support this idea using a well-known model: the interaction of the Pho4 protein with the PHO5 gene promoter. We have also applied the technique to demonstrate that Mig1 protein binds to two motifs in the promoter of HXK2 gene.

The currently available genetic methods such as the two-hybrid system and the protein recruitment system are relatively limited in their ability to identify interactions with integral membrane proteins. Here we describe the development of a reverse Ras recruitment system (reverse RRS), in which the bait used encodes a membrane protein. The bait is expressed in its natural environment, the membrane, whereas the protein partner (the prey) is fused to a cytoplasmic Ras mutant. Protein-protein interaction between the proteins encoded by the prey and the bait results in Ras membrane translocation and activation of a viability pathway in yeast. We devised the expression of the bait and prey proteins under the control of dual distinct inducible promoters, thus enabling a rapid selection of transformants in which growth is attributed solely to specific protein-protein interaction. The reverse RRS approach greatly extends the usefulness of the protein recruitment systems and the use of integral membrane proteins as baits. The system serves as an attractive approach to explore novel protein-protein interactions with high specificity and selectivity, where other methods fail.",PMID: 11160938 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,

It exhibits 80.4% identity to the human homolog and possesses a typical leucine zipper motif. The glutathione S:-transferase (GST) pull-down assay, involving truncated and missense mutants of the chicken chromatin assembly factor-1 (chCAF-1)p48, revealed not only that a region (comprising amino acids 376-405 of chCAF-1p48 and containing the seventh WD dipeptide motif) binds to chHAT-1 in vitro, but also that mutation of the motif has no influence on the in vitro interaction. The GST pull-down assay, involving truncated and missense chHAT-1 mutants, established that a region, comprising amino acids 380-408 of chHAT-1 and containing the leucine zipper motif, is required for its in vitro interaction with chCAF-1p48. In addition, mutation of each of four Leu residues in the leucine zipper motif prevents the in vitro interaction. The yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that all four Leu residues within the leucine zipper motif of chHAT-1 are necessary for its in vivo interaction with chCAF-1p48. These results indicate not only that the proper leucine zipper motif of chHAT-1 is essential for its interaction with chCAF-1p48, but also that the propeller structure of chCAF-1p48 expected to act as a platform for protein-protein interactions may not be necessary for this interaction of chHAT-1.",PMID: 11160883 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,

However, unlike other adaptor protein-dependent pathways, the ALP pathway has not been shown to require additional accessory proteins or coat proteins, such as membrane recruitment factors or clathrin. Two independent genetic approaches have been used to identify new mutants that affect transport through the ALP pathway. These screens yielded new mutants in both VPS41 and the four AP-3 subunit genes. Two new VPS41 alleles exhibited phenotypes distinct from null mutants of VPS41, which are defective in vacuolar morphology and protein transport through both the ALP and CPY sorting pathways. The new alleles displayed severe ALP sorting defects, normal vacuolar morphology, and defects in ALP vesicle formation at the Golgi complex. Sequencing analysis of these VPS41 alleles revealed mutations encoding amino acid changes in two distinct domains of Vps41p: a conserved N-terminal domain and a C-terminal clathrin heavy-chain repeat (CHCR) domain. We demonstrate that the N-terminus of Vps41p is required for binding to AP-3, whereas the C-terminal CHCR domain directs homo-oligomerization of Vps41p.

Tryptophan fluorescence of yeast actin resolved via conserved mutations.,"Doyle TC, Hansen JE, Reisler E.","Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Molecular Biology Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA.","Actin contains four tryptophan residues, W79, W86, W340, and W356, all located in subdomain 1 of the protein. Replacement of each of these residues with either tyrosine (W79Y and W356Y) or phenylalanine (W86F and W340F) generated viable proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which, when purified, allowed the analysis of the contribution of these residues to the overall tryptophan fluorescence of actin. The sum of the relative contributions of these tryptophans was found to account for the intrinsic fluorescence of wild-type actin, indicating that energy transfer between the tryptophans is not the main determinant of their quantum yield, and that these mutations induce little conformational change to the protein. This was borne out by virtually identical polymerization rates and similar myosin interactions of each of the mutants and the wild-type actin. In addition, these mutants allowed the dissection of the microenvironment of each tryptophan as actin undergoes conformational changes upon metal cation exchange and polymerization. Based on the relative tryptophan contributions determined from single mutants, a triple mutant of yeast actin (W79) was generated that showed small intrinsic fluorescence and should be useful for studies of actin interactions with actin-binding proteins.",PMID: 11159413 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Subunit interactions influence the biochemical and biological properties of Hsp104.,"Schirmer EC, Ware DM, Queitsch C, Kowal AS, Lindquist SL.","Department of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.","Point mutations in either of the two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD) of Hsp104 (NBD1 and NBD2) eliminate its thermotolerance function in vivo. In vitro, NBD1 mutations virtually eliminate ATP hydrolysis with little effect on hexamerization; analogous NBD2 mutations reduce ATPase activity and severely impair hexamerization. We report that high protein concentrations overcome the assembly defects of NBD2 mutants and increase ATP hydrolysis severalfold, changing V(max) with little effect on K(m). In a complementary fashion, the detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate inhibits hexamerization of wild-type (WT) Hsp104, lowering V(max) with little effect on K(m). ATP hydrolysis exhibits a Hill coefficient between 1.5 and 2, indicating that it is influenced by cooperative subunit interactions. To further analyze the effects of subunit interactions on Hsp104, we assessed the effects of mutant Hsp104 proteins on WT Hsp104 activities. An NBD1 mutant that hexamerizes but does not hydrolyze ATP reduces the ATPase activity of WT Hsp104 in vitro. In vivo, this mutant is not toxic but specifically inhibits the thermotolerance function of WT Hsp104. Thus, interactions between subunits influence the ATPase activity of Hsp104, play a vital role in its biological functions, and provide a mechanism for conditionally inactivating Hsp104 function in vivo.",PMID: 11158570 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Two distinct nuclear receptor-interaction domains and CREB-binding protein-dependent transactivation function of activating signal cointegrator-2.,"Lee SK, Jung SY, Kim YS, Na SY, Lee YC, Lee JW.","Center for Ligand and Transcription, Department of Biology, Chonnam National University, Kwangju 500-757, Korea.","ASC-2 is a recently isolated transcriptional cointegrator molecule, which is amplified in human cancers and stimulates transactivation by nuclear receptors, AP-1, nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB), serum response factor (SRF), and numerous other transcription factors. ASC-2 contained two nuclear receptor-interaction domains, both of which are dependent on the integrity of their core LXXLL sequences. Surprisingly, the C-terminal LXXLL motif specifically interacted with oxysterol receptor LXRss, whereas the N-terminal motif bound a broad range of nuclear receptors. These interactions appeared to be essential because a specific subregion of ASC-2 including the N- or C-terminal LXXLL motif acted as a potent dominant negative mutant with transactivation by appropriate nuclear receptors. In addition, the autonomous transactivation domain (AD) of ASC-2 was found to consist of three separable subregions; i.e. AD1, AD2, and AD3. In particular, AD2 and AD3 were binding sites for CREB binding protein (CBP), and CBP-neutralizing E1A repressed the autonomous transactivation function of ASC-2. Furthermore, the receptor transactivation was not enhanced by ASC-2 in the presence of E1A and significantly impaired by overexpressed AD2. From these results, we concluded that ASC-2 directly binds to nuclear receptors and recruits CBP to mediate the nuclear receptor transactivation in vivo.",PMID: 11158331 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
A novel function of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC5 in cytokinesis.,"Song S, Lee KS.","Laboratory of Metabolism, Division of Basic Sciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.","Coordination of mitotic exit with timely initiation of cytokinesis is critical to ensure completion of mitotic events before cell division. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae polo kinase Cdc5 functions in a pathway leading to the degradation of mitotic cyclin Clb2, thereby permitting mitotic exit. Here we provide evidence that Cdc5 also plays a role in regulating cytokinesis and that an intact polo-box, a conserved motif in the noncatalytic COOH-terminal domain of Cdc5, is required for this event. Depletion of Cdc5 function leads to an arrest in cytokinesis. Overexpression of the COOH-terminal domain of Cdc5 (cdc5DeltaN), but not the corresponding polo-box mutant, resulted in connected cells. These cells shared cytoplasms with incomplete septa, and possessed aberrant septin ring structures. Provision of additional copies of endogenous CDC5 remedied this phenotype, suggesting a dominant-negative inhibition of cytokinesis. The polo-box-dependent interactions between Cdc5 and septins (Cdc11 and Cdc12) and genetic interactions between the dominant-negative cdc5DeltaN and Cyk2/Hof1 or Myo1 suggest that direct interactions between cdc5DeltaN and septins resulted in inhibition of Cyk2/Hof1- and Myo1-mediated cytokinetic pathways. Thus, we propose that Cdc5 may coordinate mitotic exit with cytokinesis by participating in both anaphase promoting complex activation and a polo-box-dependent cytokinetic pathway.",PMID: 11157974 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

The condition is genetically heterogeneous, with at least seven complementation groups (A-G) described. Cells from individuals who are homozygous for mutations in FA genes are characterized by chromosomal instability and hypersensitivity to DNA interstrand crosslinking agents. These features suggest a possible role for the encoded proteins in the recognition or repair of these lesions, but neither their function nor whether they operate in a concerted or discrete functional pathways is known. The recent cloning of the FANCF and FANCE genes has allowed us to investigate the interaction of the proteins encoded by five of the seven complementation groups of FA. We used the yeast two-hybrid system and co-immunoprecipitation analysis to test the 10 possible pairs of proteins for direct interaction. In addition to the previously described binding of FANCA to FANCG, we now demonstrate direct interaction of FANCF with FANCG, of FANCC with FANCE and a weaker interaction of FANCE with both FANCA and FANCG. These findings show that the newly identified FANCE protein is an integral part of the FA pathway, and support the concept of a functional link between all known proteins encoded by the genes that are mutated in this disorder. These proteins may act either as a multimeric complex or by sequential recruitment of subsets of the proteins in a common pathway that protects the genomic integrity of mammalian cells.",PMID: 11157805 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

Sir1p was physically associated with HMR in chromatin, and this association required a Sir1p-ORC interaction, suggesting that it reflected the Sir1p silencer-recognition function required for silencing. Sir1p was not associated with nonsilencer replication origins that bind the ORC, indicating that a Sir1p-ORC interaction is confined to silencers. Significantly, the other SIR genes were required for Sir1p's association with HMR. Thus, multiple protein contacts required for and unique to silent chromatin may confine a Sir1p-ORC interaction to silencers. The Sir1p was present at extremely low concentrations in yeast cells yet was associated with HMR at all stages of the cell cycle examined. These data provide insights into the mechanisms that establish and restrict the assembly of silenced chromatin to only a few discrete chromosomal domains.",PMID: 11157772 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

Similar to the ubiquitin-conjugating system, both Apg12p and Apg8p are activated by Apg7p, an E1-like enzyme. Apg12p is then transferred to Apg10p, an E2-like enzyme, and conjugated with Apg5p, whereas Apg8p is transferred to Apg3p, another E2-like enzyme, followed by conjugation with phosphatidylethanolamine. Evidence is presented here that Apg7p forms a homodimer with two active-site cysteine residues via the C-terminal region. The dimerization of Apg7p is independent of the other Apg proteins and facilitated by overexpressed Apg12p. The C-terminal 123 amino acids of Apg7p (residues 508 to 630 out of 630 amino acids) are sufficient for its dimerization, where there is neither an ATP binding domain nor an active-site cysteine essential for its E1 activity. The deletion of its carboxyl 40 amino acids (residues 591-630 out of 630 amino acids) results in several defects of not only Apg7p dimerization but also interactions with two substrates, Apg12p and Apg8p and Apg12p-Apg5p conjugation, whereas the mutant Apg7p contains both an ATP binding domain and an active-site cysteine. Furthermore, the carboxyl 40 amino acids of Apg7p are also essential for the interaction of Apg7p with Apg3p to form the E1-E2 complex for Apg8p. These results suggest that Apg7p forms a homodimer via the C-terminal region and that the C-terminal region is essential for both the activity of the E1 enzyme for Apg12p and Apg8p as well as the formation of an E1-E2 complex for Apg8p.",PMID: 11139573 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

We describe a new strategy to screen for mutations which cause specific disruption of the interaction between certain proteins in the complex, leaving other interactions intact. This approach defines distinct protein interaction domains and protein relationships within the Rad51 complex. Alignment of the mutations onto the constructed three-dimensional model of the Rad51 protein reveal possible partially overlapping interfaces for the Rad51-Rad52 and the Rad51-Rad54 interactions. Rad51-Rad55 and Rad51-Rad51 interactions are affected by the same spectrum of mutations, indicating similarity between the two modes of binding.

Duo1p and Dam1p are not required to assemble bipolar spindles, but they are required to maintain metaphase and anaphase spindle integrity. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy of duo1 and dam1 mutant spindles revealed a diverse variety of spindle defects. Our results also indicate a second, previously unidentified, role for the Duo1p/Dam1p complex. duo1 and dam1 mutants show high rates of chromosome missegregation, premature anaphase events while arrested in metaphase, and genetic interactions with a subset of kinetochore components consistent with a role in kinetochore function.

"Membrane recruitment of Aut7p in the autophagy and cytoplasm to vacuole targeting pathways requires Aut1p, Aut2p, and the autophagy conjugation complex.","Kim J, Huang WP, Klionsky DJ.","Department of Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.","Autophagy is a degradative pathway by which cells sequester nonessential, bulk cytosol into double-membrane vesicles (autophagosomes) and deliver them to the vacuole for recycling. Using this strategy, eukaryotic cells survive periods of nutritional starvation. Under nutrient-rich conditions, autophagy machinery is required for the delivery of a resident vacuolar hydrolase, aminopeptidase I, by the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway. In both pathways, the vesicle formation process requires the function of the starvation-induced Aut7 protein, which is recruited from the cytosol to the forming Cvt vesicles and autophagosomes. The membrane binding of Aut7p represents an early step in vesicle formation. In this study, we identify several requirements for Aut7p membrane association. After synthesis in the cytosol, Aut7p is proteolytically cleaved in an Aut2p-dependent manner. While this novel processing event is essential for Aut7p membrane binding, Aut7p must undergo additional physical interactions with Aut1p and the autophagy (Apg) conjugation complex before recruitment to the membrane. Lack of these interactions results in a cytosolic distribution of Aut7p rather than localization to forming Cvt vesicles and autophagosomes. This study assigns a functional role for the Apg conjugation system as a mediator of Aut7p membrane recruitment. Further, we demonstrate that Aut1p, which physically interacts with components of the Apg conjugation complex and Aut7p, constitutes an additional factor required for Aut7p membrane recruitment. These findings define a series of steps that results in the modification of Aut7p and its subsequent binding to the sequestering transport vesicles of the autophagy and cytoplasm to vacuole targeting pathways.",PMID: 11149920 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

Sixteen protein combinations were designed to probe the crystallographically defined interface between Cc and CcP. The data show that the high-affinity sites on Cc and CcP coincide with the crystallographically defined sites. Changing charged residues to alanine increases the enthalpy of complex formation by a constant amount, but the decrease in stability depends on the location of the amino acid substitution. Deleting methyl groups has a small effect on the binding enthalpy and a larger deleterious effect on the binding free energy, consistent with model studies of the hydrophobic effect, and showing that nonpolar interactions also stabilize the complex.

However, the role of the tRNA synthetase, as well as the function of the bI4 maturase, remain unclear. As a first step towards elucidating the mechanistic role of these protein splicing factors in this group I intron splicing reaction, we tested the hypothesis that both leucyl-tRNA synthetase and bI4 maturase interact directly with the bI4 intron. We developed a yeast three-hybrid system and determined that both the tRNA synthetase and bI4 maturase can bind directly and independently via RNA-protein interactions to the large bI4 group I intron. We also showed, using modified two-hybrid and three-hybrid assays, that the bI4 intron bridges interactions between the two protein splicing partners. In the presence of either the bI4 maturase or the Leu-tRNA synthetase, bI4 intron transcribed recombinantly with flanking exons in the yeast nucleus exhibited splicing activity. These data combined with previous genetic results are consistent with a novel model for a ternary splicing complex (two protein: one RNA) in which both protein splicing partners bind directly to the bI4 intron and facilitate its self-splicing activity.",PMID: 11142386 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

WW domains of Rsp5p define different functions: determination of roles in fluid phase and uracil permease endocytosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"Gajewska B, Kaminska J, Jesionowska A, Martin NC, Hopper AK, Zoladek T.","Department of Genetics, Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences, 02-106 Warsaw, Poland.","Rsp5p, ubiquitin-protein ligase, an enzyme of the ubiquitination pathway, contains three WW domains that mediate protein-protein interactions. To determine if these domains adapt Rsp5p to a subset of substrates involved in numerous cellular processes, we generated mutations in individual or combinations of the WW domains. The rsp5-w1, rsp5-w2, and rsp5-w3 mutant alleles complement RSP5 deletions at 30 degrees. Thus, individual WW domains are not essential. Each rsp5-w mutation caused temperature-sensitive growth. Among variants with mutations in multiple WW domains, only rsp5-w1w2 complemented the deletion. Thus, the WW3 domain is sufficient for Rsp5p essential functions. To determine whether rsp5-w mutations affect endocytosis, fluid phase and uracil permease (Fur4p) endocytosis was examined. The WW3 domain is important for both processes. WW2 appears not to be important for fluid phase endocytosis whereas it is important for Fur4p endocytosis.

The human histone deacetylase family.,"Gray SG, Ekstrom TJ.","Laboratory for Molecular Development and Tumor Biology, Centre for Molecular Medicine (CMM), Stockholm, S-171 76, Sweden. Steven.Gray@vai.org","Since the identification of the first histone deacetylase (Taunton et al., Science 272, 408-411), several new members have been isolated. They can loosely be separated into entities on the basis of their similarity to various yeast histone deacetylases. The first class is represented by its closeness to the yeast Rpd3-like proteins, and the second most recently discovered class has similarities to yeast Hda1-like proteins. However, due to the fact that several different research groups isolated the Hda1-like histone deacetylases independently, there have been various different nomenclatures used to describe the various members, which can lead to confusion in the interpretation of this family's functions and interactions. With the discovery of another novel murine histone deacetylase, homologous to yeast Sir2, the number of members of this family is set to increase, as 7 human homologues of this gene have been isolated. In the light of these recent discoveries, we have examined the literature data and conducted a database analysis of the isolated histone deacetylases and potential candidates. The results obtained suggest that the number of histone deacetylases within the human genome may be as high as 17 and are discussed in relation to their homology to the yeast histone deacetylases.

Here we show that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sgs1 and Top3 proteins physically interact in cell extracts and bind directly in vitro. Sgs1 and Top3 proteins coimmunoprecipitate from cell extracts under stringent conditions, indicating that Sgs1 and Top3 are present in a stable complex. The domain of Sgs1 which interacts with Top3 was identified by expressing Sgs1 truncations in yeast. The results indicate that the NH(2)-terminal 158 amino acids of Sgs1 are sufficient for the high affinity interaction between Sgs1 and Top3. In vitro assays using purified Top3 and NH(2)-terminal Sgs1 fragments demonstrate that at least part of the interaction is through direct protein-protein interactions with these 158 amino acids. Consistent with these physical data, we find that mutant phenotypes caused by a point mutation or small deletions in the Sgs1 NH(2) terminus can be suppressed by Top3 overexpression. We conclude that Sgs1 and Top3 form a tight complex in vivo and that the first 158 amino acids of Sgs1 are necessary and sufficient for this interaction. Thus, a primary role of the Sgs1 amino terminus is to mediate the Top3 interaction.",PMID: 11124263 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

We isolated and characterized mutations in the RFC5 gene that could suppress the cold-sensitive phenotype of rfc1-1 mutants. Analysis of the RFC5 suppressors revealed that they could not suppress the elongated telomere phenotype, the sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, or the mutator phenotype of rfc1-1 mutants. Unlike the checkpoint-defective rfc5-1 mutation, the RFC5 suppressor mutations did not interfere with the methylmethane sulfonate- or hydroxyurea-induced phosphorylation of Rad53p.

As a first step toward testing this idea, we devised a genetic screen to isolate mutations in Bicoid that specifically disrupt cooperative interactions, but do not disrupt DNA recognition or transcription activation. The screen was carried out in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and 12 cooperativity mutants were identified. The mutations map across most of the Bicoid protein, with some located within the DNA-binding domain (homeodomain). Four homeodomain mutants were characterized in yeast and shown to activate a single-site reporter gene to levels comparable to that of wild-type, indicating that DNA binding per se is not affected. However, these mutants failed to show cooperative coupling between high and low-affinity sites, and showed reduced activation of a reporter gene carrying a natural Drosophila enhancer. Homology modeling indicated that none of the four mutations is in residues that contact DNA. Instead, these residues are likely to interact with other DNA-bound Bicoid monomers or other parts of the Bicoid protein. In vitro, the isolated homeodomains did not show strong cooperativity defects, supporting the idea that other regions of Bicoid are also important for cooperativity.

The solution structures of the FHA2 domain of Rad53 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and its complex with a pTyr peptide, have been reported recently. We now report the solution structure of the other FHA domain of Rad53, FHA1 (residues 14-164), and identification of binding sites of FHA1 and its target protein Rad9. The FHA1 structure consists of 11 beta-strands, which form two large twisted anti-parallel beta-sheets folding into a beta-sandwich. Three short alpha-helices were also identified. The beta-strands are linked by several loops and turns. These structural features of free FHA1 are similar to those of free FHA2, but there are significant differences in the loops. Screening of a peptide library [XXX(pT)XXX] against FHA1 revealed an absolute requirement for Asp at the +3 position and a preference for Ala at the +2 position. These two criteria are met by a pThr motif (192)TEAD(195) in Rad9. Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that a pThr peptide containing this motif, (188)SLEV(pT)EADATFVQ(200) from Rad9, binds to FHA1 with a K(d) value of 0.36 microM. Other peptides containing pTXXD sequences also bound to FHA1, but less tightly (K(d)=4-70 microM). These results suggest that Thr192 of Rad9 is the likely phosphorylation site recognized by the FHA1 domain of Rad53. The tight-binding peptide was then used to identify residues of FHA1 involved in the interaction with the pThr peptide. The results are compared with the interactions between the FHA2 domain and a pTyr peptide derived from Rad9 reported previously.

We propose that overcoming a cell integrity defect associated with the mitotic arrest enables the defective spindle pole bodies to provide sufficient function for proliferation of a large proportion of mutant cells.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, there are four distinct P-proteins: P1A, P1B, P2A and P2B. In spite of the high level of their structural homology, they are not completely equivalent and may perform different functions. As yet, the protein-protein interactions between yeast P-proteins have not been fully defined. In this paper, the interplay between yeast P-proteins has been investigated by means of a two-hybrid system, chemical cross-linking and gel filtration. The data presented herein show that all P-proteins are able to form homo-oligomeric complexes. By analyzing hetero-interactions, we were able to detect strong interactions between P1A and P2B proteins. Additionally, the pair of P1B and P2A proteins is also able to form a hetero-complex, though at a very low efficiency. All P-proteins are phosphorylated by numerous protein kinases. Using the multifunctional protein kinase CK II, we have shown that incorporation of phosphate into P1A protein can exert its effect on the hetero-oligomerization process, namely by preventing the formation of the hetero-oligomer P1A-P/P2B. These findings are the first to show differences in the oligomerization behavior of the yeast P-proteins; moreover, they emphasize a significant impact of the phosphorylation on the formations of P-protein complex."

Phenotypic analysis of deletion and point mutations, in conjunction with a yeast two-hybrid assay, revealed that Nam1p, a protein involved in RNA processing and translation in mitochondria, binds specifically to this domain. The significance of this interaction in vivo was demonstrated by the fact that the temperature-sensitive phenotype of a deletion mutation (rpo41Delta2), which impinges on this amino-terminal domain, is suppressed by overproducing Nam1p. In addition, mutations in the amino-terminal domain result specifically in decreased steady-state levels of mature mitochondrial CYTB and COXI transcripts, which is a primary defect observed in NAM1 null mutant yeast strains. Finally, one point mutation (R129D) did not abolish Nam1p binding, yet displayed an obvious COX1/CYTB transcript defect. This mutation exhibited the most severe mitochondrial phenotype, suggesting that mutations in the amino-terminal domain can perturb other critical interactions, in addition to Nam1p binding, that contribute to the observed phenotypes. These results implicate the amino-terminal domain of mtRNA polymerases in coupling additional factors and activities involved in mitochondrial gene expression directly to the transcription machinery."

Here we report that each individual member of AtCBL family specifically interacts with a subset of CIPKs and present structural basis for the interaction and for the specificity underlying these interactions. Although the C-terminal region of CIPKs is responsible for interaction with AtCBLs, the N-terminal region of CIPKs is also involved in determining the specificity of such interaction. We have also shown that all three EF-hand motifs in AtCBL members are required for the interaction with CIPKs. Several AtCBL members failed to interact with any of the CIPKs presented in this study, suggesting that these AtCBL members either have other CIPKs as targets or they target distinct proteins other than CIPKs.

Overexpression of eIF4E leads to malignant transformation [1-3], and eIF4E is elevated in many human cancers [4-7]. In mammalian cells, three eIF4E-binding proteins each interact with eIF4E and inhibit its function [8-10]. In yeast, EAP1 encodes a protein that binds eIF4E and inhibits cap-dependent translation in vitro [11]. A point mutation in the canonical eIF4E-binding motif of Eap1p blocks its interaction with eIF4E [11]. Here, we characterized the genetic interactions between EAP1 and NDC1, a gene whose function is required for duplication of the spindle pole body (SPB) [12], the centrosome-equivalent organelle in yeast that functions as the centrosome. We found that the deletion of EAP1 is lethal when combined with the ndc1-1 mutation. Mutations in NDC1 or altered NDC1 gene dosage lead to genetic instability [13,14]. Yeast strains lacking EAP1 also exhibit genetic instability. We tested whether these phenotypes are due to loss of EAP1 function in regulating translation. We found that both the synthetic lethal phenotype and the genetic instability phenotypes are rescued by a mutant allele of EAP1 that is unable to bind eIF4E. Our findings suggest that Eap1p carries out an eIF4E-independent function to maintain genetic stability, most likely involving SPBs."

Association of MEF2 with histone deacetylases (HDAC) -4 and -5 results in repression of MEF2 target genes and inhibition of myogenesis. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) signaling promotes myogenesis by disrupting MEF2-HDAC complexes and stimulating HDAC nuclear export. To further define the mechanisms that confer CaMK responsiveness to HDAC4 and -5, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens to identify HDAC-interacting factors. These screens revealed interactions between HDAC4 and members of the 14-3-3 family of proteins, which function as signal-dependent intracellular chaperones. HDAC4 binds constitutively to 14-3-3 in yeast and mammalian cells, whereas HDAC5 binding to 14-3-3 is largely dependent on CaMK signaling. CaMK phosphorylates serines -259 and -498 in HDAC5, which subsequently serve as docking sites for 14-3-3. Our studies suggest that 14-3-3 binding to HDAC5 is required for CaMK-dependent disruption of MEF2-HDAC complexes and nuclear export of HDAC5, and implicate 14-3-3 as a signal-dependent regulator of muscle cell differentiation."

In mammalian cells, NMD appears to involve splicing-dependent alterations to mRNA as well as ribosome-associated components of the translational apparatus. To date, human (h) Upf1 protein (p) (hUpf1p), a group 1 RNA helicase named after its Saccharomyces cerevisiae orthologue that functions in both translation termination and NMD, has been the only factor shown to be required for NMD in mammalian cells. Here, we describe human orthologues to S. cerevisiae Upf2p and S. cerevisiae Upf3p (Caenorhabditis elegans SMG-4) based on limited amino acid similarities. The existence of these orthologues provides evidence for a higher degree of evolutionary conservation of NMD than previously appreciated. Interestingly, human orthologues to S. cerevisiae Upf3p (C. elegans SMG-4) derive from two genes, one of which is X-linked and both of which generate multiple isoforms due to alternative pre-mRNA splicing. We demonstrate using immunoprecipitations of epitope-tagged proteins transiently produced in HeLa cells that hUpf2p interacts with hUpf1p, hUpf3p-X, and hUpf3p, and we define the domains required for the interactions. Furthermore, we find by using indirect immunofluorescence that hUpf1p is detected only in the cytoplasm, hUpf2p is detected primarily in the cytoplasm, and hUpf3p-X localizes primarily to nuclei. The finding that hUpf3p-X is a shuttling protein provides additional indication that NMD has both nuclear and cytoplasmic components."

The secondary structures of all new transmembrane peptides and previously synthesized peptides corresponding to domains 6 and 7 were assessed using a detailed CD analysis in trifluoroethanol, trifluoroethanol-water mixtures, sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles, and dimyristoyl phosphatidyl choline bilayers. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching experiments were used to assess the penetration of the membrane peptides into lipid bilayers. All peptides were predominantly (40-80%) helical in trifluoroethanol and most trifluoroethanol-water mixtures.

The SMT genes from several plants and fungi have been cloned, sequenced and expressed in bacteria or yeast and bioengineered into tobacco or tomato plants.

By using the structures of other helicases as a template, compact structures can be modeled for eIF4A that suggest (i) helicase motif IV binds RNA; (ii) Arg-298, which is conserved in the DEA(D/H)-box RNA helicase family but is absent from many other helicases, also binds RNA; and (iii) motifs V and VI ""link"" the carboxyl-terminal domain to the amino-terminal domain through interactions with ATP and the DEA(D/H) motif, providing a mechanism for coupling ATP binding and hydrolysis with conformational changes that modulate RNA binding.",PMID: 11087862 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,328: Biochemistry  2000 Nov 21;39(46):14103-12 ,Biochemical and structural analysis of the interaction between the UBA(2) domain of the DNA repair protein HHR23A and HIV-1 Vpr.
"The DNA repair protein HHR23A is a highly conserved protein that functions in nucleotide excision repair. HHR23A contains two ubiquitin associated domains (UBA) that are conserved in a number of proteins with diverse functions involved in ubiquitination, UV excision repair, and signaling pathways via protein kinases. The cellular binding partners of UBA domains remain unclear; however, we previously found that the HHR23A UBA(2) domain interacts specifically with the HIV-1 Vpr protein. Analysis of the low resolution solution structure of HHR23A UBA(2) revealed a hydrophobic loop region of the UBA(2) domain that we predicted was the interface for protein/protein interactions. Here we present results of in vitro binding studies that demonstrate the requirement of this hydrophobic loop region for interaction with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) Vpr. A single point mutation of the Pro at residue 333 to a Glu totally abolishes the binding of HIV-1 Vpr to UBA(2). High resolution NMR structures of the binding deficient UBA(2) mutant P333E as well as of the wild-type UBA(2) domain were determined to compare the effect of this mutation on the structure. Small but significant differences are observed only locally at the site of the mutation. The biochemical and structural analysis confirms the function of the HHR23A UBA(2) GFP-loop as the protein/protein interacting domain.",PMID: 11087358 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,329: Curr Biol  2000 Nov 2;10(21):1375-8 ,The spindle checkpoint of Saccharomyces cerevisiae responds to separable microtubule-dependent events.
,"The spindle checkpoint regulates microtubule-based chromosome segregation and helps to maintain genomic stability [1,2]. Mutational inactivation of spindle checkpoint genes has been implicated in the progression of several types of human cancer. Recent evidence from budding yeast suggests that the spindle checkpoint is complex. Order-of-function experiments have defined two separable pathways within the checkpoint. One pathway, defined by MAD2, controls the metaphase-to-anaphase transition and the other, defined by BUB2, controls the exit from mitosis [3-6]. The relationships between the separate branches of the checkpoint, and especially the events that trigger the pathways, have not been defined. We localized a Bub2p-GFP fusion protein to the cytoplasmic side of the spindle pole body and used a kar9 mutant to show that cells with misoriented spindles are arrested in anaphase of mitosis. We used a kar9 bub2 double mutant to show that the arrest is BUB2 dependent. We conclude that the separate pathways of the spindle checkpoint respond to different classes of microtubules. The MAD2 branch of the pathway responds to kinetochore microtubule interactions and the BUB2 branch of the pathway operates within the cytoplasm, responding to spindle misorientation.",PMID: 11084338 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,330: Anal Chem  2000 Nov 1;72(21):5151-7 
"Department of Chemistry, School of Science, University of Tokyo, Japan.","We describe a new method with general applicability for monitoring any protein-protein interaction in vivo. The principle is based on a protein splicing system, which involves a self-catalyzed excision of protein splicing elements, or inteins, from flanking polypeptide sequences, or exteins, leading to formation of a new protein in which the exteins are linked directly by a peptide bond. As the exteins, split N- and C-terminal halves of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were used. When a single peptide consisting of an intein derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae intervening the split EGFP was expressed in Escherichia coli, the two external regions of EGFP were ligated, thereby forming the EGFP corresponding fluorophore. Genetic alteration of the intein, which involved large deletion of the central region encoding 104 amino acids, was performed. In the expression of the residual N- and C-terminal intein fragments each fused to the split EGFP exteins, the splicing in trans did not proceed. However, upon coexpression of calmodulin and its target peptide M13, each connected to the N- and C-terminal inteins, fluorescence of EGFP was observed. These results demonstrate that interaction of calmodulin and M13 triggers the refolding of intein, which induces the protein splicing, thereby folding the ligated extein correctly for yielding the EGFP fluorophore. This method opens a new way not only to screen protein-protein interactions but also to visualize the interaction in vivo in transgenic animals.",PMID: 11080857 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,331: EMBO J  2000 Nov 15;19(22):6141-9

We report the crystal structure at 1.9 A resolution of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Gcn5p bromodomain complexed with a peptide corresponding to residues 15-29 of histone H4 acetylated at the zeta-N of lysine 16. We show that this bromodomain preferentially binds to peptides containing an N:-acetyl lysine residue. Only residues 16-19 of the acetylated peptide interact with the bromodomain. The primary interaction is the N:-acetyl lysine binding in a cleft with the specificity provided by the interaction of the amide nitrogen of a conserved asparagine with the oxygen of the acetyl carbonyl group. A network of water-mediated H-bonds with protein main chain carbonyl groups at the base of the cleft contributes to the binding. Additional side chain binding occurs on a shallow depression that is hydrophobic at one end and can accommodate charge interactions at the other. These findings suggest that the Gcn5p bromodomain may discriminate between different acetylated lysine residues depending on the context in which they are displayed.,PMID: 11080160 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,332: Methods Enzymol  2000;328:297-321

In addition to protecting cells by preventing the translation of potentially deleterious truncated peptides, studies have suggested that NMD plays a broader role in the regulation of the steady-state levels of physiologic transcripts. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, three trans-acting factors (Upf1p to Upf3p) are required for NMD. Orthologues of Upf1p have been identified in numerous species, showing that the NMD machinery, at least in part, is conserved through evolution. In this study, we demonstrate additional functional conservation of the NMD pathway through the identification of Upf2p homologues in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and humans (rent2). Disruption of S. pombe UPF2 established that this gene is required for NMD in fission yeast. rent2 was demonstrated to interact directly with rent1, a known trans-effector of NMD in mammalian cells. Additionally, fragments of rent2 were shown to possess nuclear targeting activity, although the native protein localizes to the cytoplasmic compartment. Finally, novel functional domains of Upf2p and rent2 with homology to eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) and other translational regulatory proteins were identified. Directed mutations within these so-called eIF4G homology (4GH) domains were sufficient to abolish the function of S. pombe Upf2p. Furthermore, using the two-hybrid system, we obtained evidence for direct interaction between rent2 and human eIF4AI and Sui1, both components of the translation initiation complex. Based on these findings, a novel model in which Upf2p and rent2 effects decreased translation and accelerated decay of nonsense transcripts through competitive interactions with eIF4G-binding partners is proposed.",PMID: 11073994 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

This family includes BAF (also called hSWI/SNF-A) and PBAF (hSWI/SNF-B) from humans and SWI/SNF and Rsc from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the relationship between the human and yeast complexes is unclear because all human subunits published to date are similar to those of both yeast SWI/SNF and Rsc. Also, the two human complexes have many identical subunits, making it difficult to distinguish their structures or functions. Here we describe the cloning and characterization of BAF250, a subunit present in human BAF but not PBAF. BAF250 contains structural motifs conserved in yeast SWI1 but not in any Rsc components, suggesting that BAF is related to SWI/SNF. BAF250 is also a homolog of the Drosophila melanogaster Osa protein, which has been shown to interact with a SWI/SNF-like complex in flies. BAF250 possesses at least two conserved domains that could be important for its function. First, it has an AT-rich DNA interaction-type DNA-binding domain, which can specifically bind a DNA sequence known to be recognized by a SWI/SNF family-related complex at the beta-globin locus. Second, BAF250 stimulates glucocorticoid receptor-dependent transcriptional activation, and the stimulation is sharply reduced when the C-terminal region of BAF250 is deleted. This region of BAF250 is capable of interacting directly with the glucocorticoid receptor in vitro. Our data suggest that BAF250 confers specificity to the human BAF complex and may recruit the complex to its targets through either protein-DNA or protein-protein interactions.",PMID: 11073988 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

Deletion of a distinct activator binding region of Mediator completely compromised gene activation in vivo by some, but not all, transcriptional activators.

These translocated effectors contribute to the pathogen's ability to infect and replicate within plant and animal hosts. The amino terminus of effector proteins contains sequences that are necessary and sufficient for both secretion and translocation by TTSS. Portions of these sequences contain binding sites for type III chaperones, which facilitate efficient secretion and translocation of specific effectors through TTSS. In this study, we have utilized the yeast two-hybrid assay to identify protein-protein interactions between effector and chaperone proteins encoded within Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1). Several interactions were identified including a novel interaction between the effector protein, SspA (SipA), and a putative chaperone, InvB. InvB was demonstrated to bind to the amino terminus of SspA in the bacterial cytoplasm. Furthermore, InvB acts as a type III chaperone for the efficient secretion and translocation of SspA by SPI-1. InvB also permitted translocation of SspA through the SPI-2 TTSS, indicating that it is an important regulator in the recognition of SspA as a target of TTSS.

However, this flexibility in dimerization had not been documented for yeast bHLH proteins. Using the yeast two-hybrid assay and a biochemical assay we show that Ino4p dimerizes with the Pho4p, Rtg1p, Rtg3p and Sgc1p bHLH proteins. Screening a yeast cDNA library identified three additional proteins that interact with Ino4p: Bck2p, YLR422W and YNR064C. The interaction with Bck2p prompted us to examine if any of the Bck2p-associated functions affect expression of phospholipid biosynthetic genes. We found that hyperosmotic growth conditions altered the growth phase regulation of a phospholipid biosynthetic gene, CHO1. There are two recent reports of initial whole genome yeast two-hybrid interactions. Interestingly, one of these reports identified five proteins that interact with Ino4p: Ino2p, Hcs1p, Apl2p, YMR317W and YNL279W. Ino2p is the only protein in common with the data presented here.

An in vivo competition assay allowed us to characterize and dissect physical and functional interactions between Sec62p and components of the Sec-complex. We could show that Sec62p binds via its cytosolic N- and C-terminal domains to the Sec-complex. The N-terminal domain, which harbors the major interaction site, binds directly to the last 14 residues of Sec63p. The C-terminal binding site of Sec62p is less important for complex stability, but adjoins the region in Sec62p that might be involved in signal sequence recognition."

Loss of Clb5-dependent kinase activity under conditions of attenuated Cdc28 function disrupts this program, resulting in diploid-specific lethality. Here we show that polarity loss is tolerated by haploids due to a more prominent contribution of microtubule-neck interactions to spindle orientation inherent to haploids. These differences are mediated by the relative partition of Bud6 between the bud tip and bud neck, distinguishing haploids from diploids. Bud6 localizes initially to the bud tip and accumulates at the neck concomitant with spindle assembly. bud6Delta mutant phenotypes are consistent with Bud6's role as a cortical cue for cytoplasmic microtubule capture. Moreover, mutations that affect Bud6 localization and partitioning disrupt the sequential program of microtubule-cortex interactions accordingly. These data support a model whereby Bud6 sequentially cues microtubule capture events at the bud tip followed by capture events at the bud neck, necessary for correct spindle morphogenesis and polarity."

Glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments showed the direct interaction of in vitro translated p110, p64, and p58 of the essential CBF3 kinetochore protein complex with Cbf1p, a basic region helix-loop-helix zipper protein (bHLHzip) that specifically binds to the CDEI region on the centromere DNA. Furthermore, recombinant p64 and p23 each stimulated the in vitro DNA binding activity of Cbf1p. The N-terminal 70 amino acids of p23 were sufficient to mediate this effect. P64 could also promote the multimerization activity of Cbf1p in the presence of centromere DNA in vitro. These results show the direct physical interaction of Cbf1p and CBF3 subunits and provide evidence that CBF3 components can promote the binding of Cbf1p to its binding site in the yeast kinetochore.

In vitro, Tup1 interacts preferentially with underacetylated isoforms of H3 and H4, suggesting that histone acetylation may modulate Tup1 functions in vivo. Here we report that histone hyperacetylation caused by combined mutations in genes encoding the histone deacetylases (HDACs) Rpd3, Hos1, and Hos2 abolishes Ssn6-Tup1 repression. Unlike HDAC mutations that do not affect repression, this combination of mutations causes concomitant hyperacetylation of both H3 and H4.

In plants, the FHA domain is part of a protein that is localized to the plasma membrane and participates in the regulation of receptor-like protein kinase signaling pathways. Recent studies show that a functional FHA domain consists of 120-140 amino acid residues, which is significantly larger than the sequence motif first described. Although FHA domains do not exhibit extensive sequence similarity, they share similar secondary and tertiary structures, featuring a sandwich of two anti-parallel (beta)-sheets. One intriguing finding is that FHA domains may bind phosphothreonine, phosphoserine and sometimes phosphotyrosine, distinguishing them from other well-studied phosphoprotein-binding domains. The diversity of proteins containing FHA domains and potential differences in binding specificities suggest the FHA domain is involved in coordinating diverse cellular processes."

"Transcription by RNA polymerase II is accompanied by cyclic phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal heptapeptide repeat domain (CTD) of its largest subunit. We have used deletion and point mutations in Fcp1p, a TFIIF-interacting CTD phosphatase, to show that the integrity of its BRCT domain, like that of its catalytic domain, is important for cell viability, mRNA synthesis, and CTD dephosphorylation in vivo. Although regions of Fcp1p carboxy terminal to its BRCT domain and at its amino terminus were not essential for viability, deletion of either of these regions affected the phosphorylation state of the CTD. Two portions of this carboxy-terminal region of Fcp1p bound directly to the first cyclin-like repeat in the core domain of the general transcription factor TFIIB, as well as to the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF. These regulatory interactions with Fcp1p involved closely related amino acid sequence motifs in TFIIB and RAP74. Mutating the Fcp1p-binding motif KEFGK in the RAP74 (Tfg1p) subunit of TFIIF to EEFGE led to both synthetic phenotypes in certain fcp1 tfg1 double mutants and a reduced ability of Fcp1p to activate transcription when it is artificially tethered to a promoter. These results suggest strongly that this KEFGK motif in RAP74 mediates its interaction with Fcp1p in vivo.",PMID: 11003641 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,380: RNA  2000 Sep;6(9):1289-305 ,The carboxy terminal WD domain of the pre-mRNA splicing factor Prp17p is critical for function.
"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Prp17p is required for the efficient completion of the second step of pre-mRNA splicing. The function and interacting factors for this protein have not been elucidated. We have performed a mutational analysis of yPrp17p to identify protein domains critical for function. A series of deletions were made throughout the region spanning the N-terminal 158 amino acids of the protein, which do not contain any identified structural motifs. The C-terminal portion (amino acids 160-455) contains a WD domain containing seven WD repeats. We determined that a minimal functional Prp17p consists of the WD domain and 40 amino acids N-terminal to it. We generated a three-dimensional model of the WD repeats in Prp17p based on the crystal structure of the beta-transducin WD domain. This model was used to identify potentially important amino acids for in vivo functional characterization. Through analysis of mutations in four different loops of Prp17p that lie between beta strands in the WD repeats, we have identified four amino acids, 235TETG238, that are critical for function. These amino acids are predicted to be surface exposed and may be involved in interactions that are important for splicing. Temperature-sensitive prp17 alleles with mutations of these four amino acids are defective for the second step of splicing and are synthetically lethal with a U5 snRNA loop I mutation, which is also required for the second step of splicing. These data reinforce the functional significance of this region within the WD domain of Prp17p in the second step of splicing.",PMID: 10999606 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,381: Structure Fold Des  2000 Aug 15;8(8):841-50 ,"Crystal structure and mutational analysis of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle regulatory protein Cks1: implications for domain swapping, anion binding and protein interactions."
"BACKGROUND: The Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein Cks1 (cyclin-dependent kinase subunit 1) is essential for cell-cycle progression. The biological function of Cks1 can be modulated by a switch between two distinct molecular assemblies: the single domain fold, which results from the closing of a beta-hinge motif, and the intersubunit beta-strand interchanged dimer, which arises from the opening of the beta-hinge motif. The crystal structure of a cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) in complex with the human Cks homolog CksHs1 single-domain fold revealed the importance of conserved hydrophobic residues and charged residues within the beta-hinge motif. RESULTS: The 3.0 A resolution Cks1 structure reveals the strict structural conservation of the Cks alpha/beta-core fold and the beta-hinge motif. The beta hinge identified in the Cks1 structure includes a novel pivot and exposes a cluster of conserved tyrosine residues that are involved in Cdk binding but are sequestered in the beta-interchanged Cks homolog suc1 dimer structure. This Cks1 structure confirms the conservation of the Cks anion-binding site, which interacts with sidechain residues from the C-terminal alpha helix of another subunit in the crystal. CONCLUSIONS: The Cks1 structure exemplifies the conservation of the beta-interchanged dimer and the anion-binding site in evolutionarily distant yeast and human Cks homologs. Mutational analyses including in vivo rescue of CKS1 disruption support the dual functional roles of the beta-hinge residue Glu94, which participates in Cdk binding, and of the anion-binding pocket that is located 22 A away and on an opposite face to Glu94. The Cks1 structure suggests a biological role for the beta-interchanged dimer and the anion-binding site in targeting Cdks to specific phosphoproteins during cell-cycle progression.",PMID: 10997903 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,382: Yeast  2000 Sep 30;16(13):1229-41 ,"A network of proteins around Rvs167p and Rvs161p, two proteins related to the yeast actin cytoskeleton."
"The Rvs161p and Rvs167p proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, homologues of higher eukaryotes' amphiphysins, associate with actin and appear to be involved in several functions related to the actin cytoskeleton. In order to identify partners of the Rvsp proteins, yeast libraries constructed in two-hybrid vectors were screened using either Rvs167p or Rvs161p as a bait. The selected candidates, representing 34 ORFs, were then tested against both Rvsp proteins, as well as domains of Rvs167p or Rvs161p. Among the most significant ones, 24 ORFs were specific preys of Rvs167p only and two gave interactions with Rvs161p only. Interestingly, five ORFs were preys of both Rvs161p and Rvs167p (RVS167, LAS17, YNL094w, YMR192w and YPL249c).

"Members of the newly discovered regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) families of proteins have a common RGS domain. This RGS domain is necessary for conferring upon RGS proteins the capacity to regulate negatively a variety of Galpha protein subunits. However, RGS proteins are more than simply negative regulators of signaling. RGS proteins can function as effector antagonists, and recent evidence suggests that RGS proteins can have positive effects on signaling as well. Many RGS proteins possess additional C- and N-terminal modular protein-binding domains and motifs. The presence of these additional modules within the RGS proteins provides for multiple novel regulatory interactions performed by these molecules. These regions are involved in conferring regulatory selectivity to specific Galpha-coupled signaling pathways, enhancing the efficacy of the RGS domain, and the translocation or targeting of RGS proteins to intracellular membranes. In other instances, these domains are involved in cross-talk between different Galpha-coupled signaling pathways and, in some cases, likely serve to integrate small GTPases with these G protein signaling pathways. This review discusses these C- and N-terminal domains and their roles in the biology of the brain-enriched RGS proteins. Methods that can be used to investigate the function of these domains are also discussed.","Publication Types: Review Review, Tutorial",PMID: 10987813 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,384: FEBS Lett  2000 Sep 8;481(1):13-8

In this process, cortical Kar9p in the bud acts as a link between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. To identify Kar9p-interacting proteins, a two-hybrid screen was conducted with the use of full-length Kar9p as bait, and three genes were identified: BIM1, STU2, and KAR9 itself. STU2 encodes a component of the spindle pole body. Bim1p is the yeast homologue of the human microtubule-binding protein EB1, which is a binding partner to the adenomatous polyposis coli protein involved in colon cancer. Eighty-nine amino acids within the third quarter of Bim1p was sufficient to confer interaction with Kar9p. The two-hybrid interactions were confirmed with the use of coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Genetic analysis placed Bim1p in the Kar9p pathway for nuclear migration. Bim1p was not required for Kar9p's cortical or spindle pole body localization. However, deletion of BIM1 eliminated Kar9p localization along cytoplasmic microtubules. Furthermore, in the bim1 mutants, the cytoplasmic microtubules no longer intersected the cortical dot of Green Fluorescent Protein-Kar9p.

Colonies with low beta-galactosidase activity were analyzed to locate mutations in MPsi sequences affecting binding to Gag proteins. This genetic assay delineated secondary structural elements that are important for efficient RNA binding, including a single-stranded small bulge containing the initiation codon for uORF3, as well as adjacent stem structures. This implies a possible tertiary structure favoring the high-affinity binding sites for Gag.

The human catalytic subunit PP2Acalpha functionally replaces the endogenous yeast enzyme, Pph22p, indicating a conservation of function in vivo. Therefore, yeast cells were employed to explore the role of invariant PP2Ac residues. The PP2Acalpha Y127N substitution abolished essential PP2Ac function in vivo and impaired catalysis severely in vitro, consistent with the prediction from structural studies that Tyr-127 mediates substrate binding and its side chain interacts with the key active site residues His-118 and Asp-88. The V159E substitution similarly impaired PP2Acalpha catalysis profoundly and may cause global disruption of the active site. Two conditional mutations in the yeast Pph22p protein, F232S and P240H, were found to cause temperature-sensitive impairment of PP2Ac catalytic function in vitro. Thus, the mitotic and cell lysis defects conferred by these mutations result from a loss of PP2Ac enzyme activity. Substitution of the PP2Acalpha C-terminal Tyr-307 residue by phenylalanine impaired protein function, whereas the Y307D and T304D substitutions abolished essential function in vivo. Nevertheless, Y307D did not reduce PP2Acalpha catalytic activity significantly in vitro, consistent with an important role for the C terminus in mediating essential protein-protein interactions.

Gal11 and the general transcription factor (TF) IIE are involved in regulation of the protein kinase activity of TFIIH that phosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. We have previously shown that Gal11 binds the small and large subunits of TFIIE at two Gal11 domains, A and B, respectively, which are important for normal function of Gal11 in vivo. Here we demonstrate that Gal11 binds directly to TFIIH through domain A in vitro. A null mutation in GAL11 caused lethality of cells when combined with temperature-sensitive mutations in the genes encoding TFIIE or the carboxyl-terminal domain kinase, indicating the presence of genetic interactions between Gal11 and these proteins. Mutational depletion of Gal11 or TFIIE caused inefficient opening of the transcription initiation region, but had no significant effect on TATA-binding protein occupancy of the TATA sequence in vivo. These results suggest that the functions of Gal11 and TFIIE are necessary after recruitment of TATA-binding protein to the TATA box presumably at the step of stable preinitiation complex formation and/or promoter melting.

However, ADs show no apparent sequence conservation, they can be functionally replaced by a number of random peptides and unrelated proteins, and their function does not depend on sustaining a complex tertiary structure. To gain a broader perspective on the nature of interactions between acidic ADs and several of their proposed targets, the in vivo strengths of viral, human, yeast, and artificial activation domains were determined under physiological conditions, and mutant ADs with increased in vivo potencies were selected. The affinities between ADs and proposed targets were determined in vitro and all interactions were found to be of low-level affinity with dissociation constants above 10(-7)M. However, in vivo potencies of all ADs correlated nearly perfectly with their affinities for transcriptional proteins. Surprisingly, the weak interactions of the different ADs with at least two non-transcriptional proteins show the same rank order of binding and AD mutants selected for increased in vivo strength also have increased affinities to non-transcriptional proteins. Based on these results, isolated acidic ADs can bind with relatively low-level specificity and affinity to many different proteins and the strength of these semi-specific interactions determine the strength of an AD. I suggest that ADs expose flexible hydrophobic elements in an aqueous environment to contact hydrophobic patches over short distances, shifting specificity of activators largely to the DNA colocalization of arrays of ADs and targets.

Mechanisms and control of mRNA decapping in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"Tucker M, Parker R.","Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona 85721, USA.","The process of mRNA turnover is a critical component of the regulation of gene expression. In the past few years a discrete set of pathways for the degradation of polyadenylated mRNAs in eukaryotic cells have been described. A major pathway of mRNA degradation in yeast occurs by deadenylation of the mRNA, which leads to a decapping reaction, thereby exposing the mRNA to rapid 5' to 3' exonucleolytic degradation. A critical step in this pathway is decapping, since it effectively terminates the existence of the mRNA and is the site of numerous control inputs. In this review, we discuss the properties of the decapping enzyme and how its activity is regulated to give rise to differential mRNA turnover. A key point is that decapping appears to be controlled by access of the enzyme to the cap structure in a competition with the translation initiation complex. Strikingly, several proteins required for mRNA decapping show interactions with the translation machinery and suggest possible mechanisms for the triggering of mRNA decapping.","Publication Types: Review Review, Academic",PMID: 10966469 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

The deduced amino acid sequence of Cbln3 was 55% identical to Cbln1 and also contained a C1q signature domain and signal sequence for secretion. In addition to binding avidly to Cbln3, Cbln1 also formed homomeric complexes. In contrast, Cbln3 homomeric association was weak. These interactions exhibited specificity because C1qB bound to neither Cbln1 nor Cbln3.

Others have shown that the Ada2 protein is required for physical interactions between some activation domains and TBP (TATA-binding protein), whereas the Gcn5 (Ada4) protein has a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. Although all HAT enzymes are able to acetylate histone substrates, some also acetylate non-histone proteins. Taken together, these observations suggest that the Ada proteins have the ability to effect different steps in the process of gene activation. It has recently been shown that the Ada proteins are present in two distinct protein complexes, the Ada complex and a larger SAGA complex. Our recent work has focused on determining (1) which of the Ada-containing complexes mediates gene activation by GR, (2) whether the HAT activity encoded by GCN5 is required for GR-dependent gene activation, (3) whether the Ada proteins contribute to GR-mediated activation at the level of chromatin remodelling and (4) how the role of these HAT complexes is integrated with other chromatin remodelling activities during GR-mediated gene activation. Our results suggest a model in which GR recruits the SAGA complex and that this contributes to chromatin remodelling via a mechanism involving the acetylation of histones.

O. Box 21, University of Helsinki, 00014 Helsinki, Finland.","Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (Cdk7) forms a trimeric complex with cyclin H and Mat1 to form the mammalian Cdk-activating kinase, CAK, as well as a part of the basal transcription factor TFIIH, where Cdk7 phosphorylates the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II. Here, we report a novel interaction between Cdk7 and a histidine triad (HIT) family protein, Hint/PKCI-1. This interaction was initially observed in a yeast two-hybrid study and subsequently verified by co-immunoprecipitation and subcellular localization studies, where overexpression of Cdk7 leads to partial relocalization of Hint to the nucleus. The physical association is independent of cyclin H binding or Cdk7 kinase activity and is conserved between the related Sacharomyces cerevisiae CTD kinase Kin28 and the HIT protein Hnt1. Furthermore, combination of a disruption of HNT1 and a KIN28 temperature-sensitive allele in S. cerevisiae led to highly elongated cell morphology and reduced colony formation, indicating a genetic interaction between KIN28 and HNT1. The physical and genetic interactions of Hint and Hnt1 with Cdk7 and Kin28 suggest a role for this class of histidine triad proteins in the regulation of Cdk7 and Kin28 functions."

All known yeast, worm, fly, and human centromere H3-like proteins have highly conserved C-terminal histone fold domains (HFD) but very different N termini. We have carried out a comprehensive and systematic mutagenesis of the Cse4p N terminus to analyze its function. Surprisingly, only a 33-amino-acid domain within the 130-amino-acid-long N terminus is required for Cse4p N-terminal function. The spacing of the essential N-terminal domain (END) relative to the HFD can be changed significantly without an apparent effect on Cse4p function. The END appears to be important for interactions between Cse4p and known kinetochore components, including the Ctf19p/Mcm21p/Okp1p complex. Genetic and biochemical evidence shows that Cse4p proteins interact with each other in vivo and that nonfunctional cse4 END and HFD mutant proteins can form functional mixed complexes. These results support different roles for the Cse4p N terminus and the HFD in centromere function and are consistent with the proposed Cse4p nucleosome model. The structure-function characteristics of the Cse4p N terminus are relevant to understanding how other H3-like proteins, such as the human homolog CENP-A, function in kinetochore assembly and chromosome segregation."

A number of cytotoxic bisdioxopiperazines such as ICRF-193 target topoisomerase II by binding and trapping the closed enzyme clamp. To investigate this unusual mode of action, we have used yeast to select plasmid-borne human topoisomerase IIalpha alleles resistant to ICRF-193. Mutations in topoisomerase IIalpha of Leu-169 to Phe (L169F) (in the N-terminal ATPase domain) and Ala-648 to Pro (A648P) (in the core domain) were identified as conferring >50-fold and 5-fold resistance to ICRF-193 in vivo, respectively. The L169F mutation, located next to the Walker A box ATP-binding sequence, resulted in a mutant enzyme displaying ICRF-193-resistant topoisomerase and ATPase activities and whose closed clamp was refractory to ICRF-193-mediated trapping as an annulus on closed circular DNA. These data imply that the mutation interferes directly with ICRF-193 binding to the N-terminal ATPase gate. In contrast, the A648P enzyme displayed topoisomerase activities exhibiting wild-type sensitivity to ICRF-193. We suggest that the inefficient trapping of the A648P closed clamp results either from the observed increased ATP requirement, or more likely, from lowered salt stability, perhaps involving destabilization of ICRF-193 interactions with the B'-B' interface in the core domain. These results provide evidence for at least two different phenotypic classes of ICRF-193 resistance mutations and suggest that bisdioxopiperazine action involves the interplay of both the ATPase and core domains of topoisomerase IIalpha."

"The eukaryotic transcript elongation factor TFIIS enables RNA polymerase II to read through blocks to elongation in vitro and interacts genetically with a variety of components of the transcription machinery in vivo. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the gene encoding TFIIS (PPR2) is not essential, and disruption strains exhibit only mild phenotypes and an increased sensitivity to 6-azauracil. The nonessential nature of TFIIS encouraged the use of a synthetic lethal screen to elucidate the in vivo roles of TFIIS as well as provide more information on other factors involved in the regulation of transcript elongation. Several genes were identified that are necessary for either cell survival or robust growth when the gene encoding TFIIS has been disrupted. These include UBP3, KEX2, STT4, and SWI2/SNF2. SWI1 and SNF5 disruptions were also synthetically lethal with ppr2Delta, suggesting that the reduced ability to remodel chromatin confers the synthetic phenotype. The synthetic phenotypes show marked osmosensitivity and cytoskeletal defects, including a terminal hyperelongated bud phenotype with the Swi-Snf complex. These results suggest that genes important in osmoregulation, cell membrane synthesis and integrity, and cell division may require the Swi-Snf complex and TFIIS for efficient transcription. The detection of these genetic interactions provides another functional link between the Swi-Snf complex and the elongation machinery.",PMID: 10913179 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,421: Glycobiology  2000 Jul;10(7):737-44 ,Evidence for interaction of yeast protein kinase C with several subunits of oligosaccharyl transferase.
"Oligosaccharyltransferase (OT) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an enzyme complex consisting of 8 transmembrane proteins located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Studies on potential protein-protein interactions in OT using a two-hybrid library screen revealed that protein kinase C (Pkc1p) interacted with the lumenal domains of several OT subunits. Additional genetic experiments revealed that overexpression of two OT subunits rescued the growth defect caused by overexpression of a Pkc1 active site mutant, implying that there are specific genetic interactions between PKC1 and OT. These in vivo findings were complemented by in vitro studies that showed that several of the OT subunits bound to a fusion protein consisting of glutathione S-transferase linked via its C-terminus to Pkc1p. Assays of OT activity, in which glycosylation of a simple acceptor peptide was assayed in microsomes from wild-type and a pkc1 null revealed a 50% reduction in activity in the microsomes from the null strain. In contrast, strains containing null mutations of two other genes known to be downstream of Pkc1p in the PKC1-MAP kinase pathway had a level of OT activity comparable to that of wild-type cells. These in vivo and in vitro experiments suggest that in yeast cells Pkc1p may be involved in regulation of the N-glycosylation of proteins.",PMID: 10910977 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,422: Structure Fold Des  2000 Jul 15;8(7):751-62 ,X-ray structure of Escherichia coli pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase complexed with FMN at 1.8 A resolution.
"BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase (PNPOx) catalyzes the terminal step in the biosynthesis of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), a cofactor used by many enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism. The enzyme oxidizes either the 4'-hydroxyl group of pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (PNP) or the 4'-primary amine of pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP) to an aldehyde. PNPOx is a homodimeric enzyme with one flavin mononucleotide (FMN) molecule non-covalently bound to each subunit. A high degree of sequence homology among the 15 known members of the PNPOx family suggests that all members of this group have similar three-dimensional folds. RESULTS: The crystal structure of PNPOx from E. coli has been determined to 1.8 A resolution. The monomeric subunit folds into an eight-stranded beta sheet surrounded by five alpha-helical structures. Two monomers related by a twofold axis interact extensively along one-half of each monomer to form the dimer. There are two clefts at the dimer interface that are symmetry-related and extend from the top to the bottom of the dimer. An FMN cofactor that makes interactions with both subunits is located in each of these two clefts. CONCLUSIONS: The structure is quite similar to the recently deposited 2.7 A structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae PNPOx and also, remarkably, shares a common structural fold with the FMN-binding protein from Desulfovibrio vulgaris and a domain of chymotrypsin. This high-resolution E. coli PNPOx structure permits predictions to be made about residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis. These predictions provide testable hypotheses, which can be answered by making site-directed mutants.",PMID: 10903950 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,423: Nucleic Acids Res  2000 Jul 15;28(14):2634-42 ,The analysis of chimeric human/rainbow trout estrogen receptors reveals amino acid residues outside of P- and D-boxes important for the transactivation function.
"The amino acid sequence of rainbow trout estrogen receptor (rtER) is highly conserved in the C domain but presents few similarities in the A/B and E domains with human estrogen receptor alpha (hER) [NR3A1]. A previous study has shown that rtER and hER have differential functional activities in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To determine the domain(s) responsible for these differences, chimeric human/rainbow trout estrogen receptors were constructed. The A/B, C/D or E/F regions of rtER were replaced by corresponding regions of hER and expressed in yeast cells. Ligand-binding and transcription activation abilities of these hybrid receptors were compared with those of wild-type rtER or hER. Surprisingly, our data revealed that the human C/D domains play an important role in the magnitude of transactivation of ER. Two other chimeric ERs carrying either a C or D domain of hER showed that the C domain was responsible for this effect whereas the D domain did not affect hybrid receptor activities. Moreover, a chimeric hER carrying the C domain of rtER showed maximal transcriptional activity similar to that observed with rtER. Gel shift assays showed that, whereas rtER and hER present a similar binding affinity to an estrogen response element (ERE) element, the rtER C domain is responsible for a weaker DNA binding stability compared to those of hER. In addition, the human C domain allows approximately 2 times faster association of ER to an ERE. Utilization of reporter genes containing one or three EREs confirms that rtER requires protein-protein interactions for its stabilization on DNA and that the C domain is involved in this stabilization. Moreover, AF-1 may be implicated in this synergistic effect of EREs. Interestingly, although E domains of these two receptors are much less conserved, replacement of this domain in rtER by its human counterpart resulted in higher estradiol sensitivity but no increase in the magnitude of transactivation. Data from the chimeric receptors, rtER(hC) and hER(rtC), demonstrated that rtER AF-1 and AF-2 activation domains activated transcription in the presence of estradiol similar to both AF-1 and AF-2 hER. This implies that these domains, which show poor sequence homology, may interact with similar basal transcription factors.",PMID: 10908317 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,424: Yeast  2000 Jun 30;17(2):95-110 ,Genome-wide protein interaction screens reveal functional networks involving Sm-like proteins.
"A set of seven structurally related Sm proteins forms the core of the snRNP particles containing the spliceosomal U1, U2, U4 and U5 snRNAs. A search of the genomic sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has identified a number of open reading frames that potentially encode structurally similar proteins termed Lsm (Like Sm) proteins. With the aim of analysing all possible interactions between the Lsm proteins and any protein encoded in the yeast genome, we performed exhaustive and iterative genomic two-hybrid screens, starting with the Lsm proteins as baits. Indeed, extensive interactions amongst eight Lsm proteins were found that suggest the existence of a Lsm complex or complexes. These Lsm interactions apparently involve the conserved Sm domain that also mediates interactions between the Sm proteins. The screens also reveal functionally significant interactions with splicing factors, in particular with Prp4 and Prp24, compatible with genetic studies and with the reported association of Lsm proteins with spliceosomal U6 and U4/U6 particles. In addition, interactions with proteins involved in mRNA turnover, such as Mrt1, Dcp1, Dcp2 and Xrn1, point to roles for Lsm complexes in distinct RNA metabolic processes, that are confirmed in independent functional studies. These results provide compelling evidence that two-hybrid screens yield functionally meaningful information about protein-protein interactions and can suggest functions for uncharacterized proteins, especially when they are performed on a genome-wide scale.

This core is unusual because it is not recognized by anti-Sm Abs and it associates with an Sm-related sequence in the trypanosome small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). Using peptide sequences derived from affinity-purified U2 snRNP proteins, we have cloned cDNAs for five common proteins of 8.5, 10, 12.5, 14, and 15 kDa of Trypanosoma brucei and identified them as Sm proteins SmF (8.5 kDa), -E (10 kDa), -D1 (12.5 kDa), -G (14 kDa), and -D2 (15 kDa), respectively. Furthermore, we found the trypanosome SmB (T. brucei) and SmD3 (Trypanosoma cruzi) homologues through database searches, thus completing a set of seven canonical Sm proteins. Sequence comparisons of the trypanosome proteins revealed several deviations in highly conserved positions from the Sm consensus motif. We have identified a network of specific heterodimeric and -trimeric Sm protein interactions in vitro. These results are summarized in a model of the trypanosome Sm core, which argues for a strong conservation of the Sm particle structure. The conservation extends also to the functional level, because at least one trypanosome Sm protein, SmG, was able to specifically complement a corresponding mutation in yeast.",PMID: 10900267 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,427: Nature  2000 Jul 6;406(6791):94-8

Its recruitment depends on a permanent protein-DNA complex consisting of the MADS box protein, Mcm1, and a recently identified partner Fkh2, a forkhead/winged helix related transcription factor. The lethality of Ndd1 depletion is suppressed by fkh2 null mutations, which indicates that Fkh2 may also have a negative regulatory role in the transcription of G2/M-induced RNAs.

"Department of Microbiology and Cancer Center, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22908, USA.","Cse4p is a structural component of the core centromere of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and is a member of the conserved CENP-A family of specialized histone H3 variants. The histone H4 allele hhf1-20 confers defects in core centromere chromatin structure and mitotic chromosome transmission. We have proposed that Cse4p and histone H4 interact through their respective histone fold domains to assemble a nucleosome-like structure at centromeric DNA. To test this model, we targeted random mutations to the Cse4p histone fold domain and isolated three temperature-sensitive cse4 alleles in an unbiased genetic screen. Two of the cse4 alleles contain mutations at the Cse4p-H4 interface. One of these requires two widely separated mutations demonstrating long-range cooperative interactions in the structure. The third cse4 allele is mutated at its helix 2-helix 3 interface, a region required for homotypic H3 fold dimerization. Overexpression of wild-type Cse4p and histone H4 confer reciprocal allele-specific suppression of cse4 and hhf1 mutations, providing strong evidence for Cse4p-H4 protein interaction. Overexpression of histone H3 is dosage lethal in cse4 mutants, suggesting that histone H3 competes with Cse4p for histone H4 binding. However, the relative resistance of the Cse4p-H4 pathway to H3 interference argues that centromere chromatin assembly must be highly regulated.",PMID: 10891506 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,429: Biochemistry  2000 Jul 11;39(27):7886-94

"A fast, isotope-free method for the determination of parameters for the interactions of proteins with thiamine and related compounds was developed. The free and bound forms of a ligand (thiamine or a fluorogenic analogue) were separated by ultrafiltration using commercially available centrifugal protein microconcentrators (Nanosep, Pall Filtron).

"The Skn7 response regulator has previously been shown to play a role in the induction of stress-responsive genes in yeast, e.g., in the induction of the thioredoxin gene in response to hydrogen peroxide. The yeast Heat Shock Factor, Hsf1, is central to the induction of another set of stress-inducible genes, namely the heat shock genes. These two regulatory trans-activators, Hsf1 and Skn7, share certain structural homologies, particularly in their DNA-binding domains and the presence of adjacent regions of coiled-coil structure, which are known to mediate protein-protein interactions. Here, we provide evidence that Hsf1 and Skn7 interact in vitro and in vivo and we show that Skn7 can bind to the same regulatory sequences as Hsf1, namely heat shock elements. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a strain deleted for the SKN7 gene and containing a temperature-sensitive mutation in Hsf1 is hypersensitive to oxidative stress. Our data suggest that Skn7 and Hsf1 cooperate to achieve maximal induction of heat shock genes in response specifically to oxidative stress. We further show that, like Hsf1, Skn7 can interact with itself and is localized to the nucleus under normal growth conditions as well as during oxidative stress.",PMID: 10888672 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,433: J Inorg Biochem  2000 May 30;80(1-2):161-8 ,Oxo-vanadium as a spin probe for the investigation of the metal coordination environment of imidazole glycerol phosphate dehydratase.
"Imidazole glycerol phosphate dehydratase (IGPD) catalyses the dehydration of imidazole glycerol phosphate to imidazole acetol phosphate, an important late step in the biosynthesis of histidine. IGPD, isolated as a low molecular weight and inactive apo-form, assembles with specific divalent metal cations to form a catalytically active high molecular weight metalloenzyme. Oxo-vanadium ions also assemble the protein into, apparently, the same high molecular weight form but, uniquely, yield a protein without catalytic activity. The VO2+ derivative of IGPD has been investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopy. The spin Hamiltonian parameters indicate the presence of multiple 14N nuclei in the inner coordination sphere of VO2+ which is corroborated by ENDOR and ESEEM spectra showing resonances attributable to interactions with 14N nuclei. The isotropic superhyperfine coupling component of about 7 MHz determined by ENDOR is consistent with a nitrogen of coordinated histidine imidazole(s). The ESEEM Fourier-transform spectra further support the notion that the VO2+ substituted enzyme contains inner-sphere nitrogen ligands. The isotropic and anisotropic 14N superhyperfine coupling components are similar to those reported for other equatorially coordinated enzymatic histidine imidazole systems. ESEEM resonances from axial 14N ligands are discussed.","Publication Types: Review Review, Tutorial",PMID: 10885480 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,434: Mol Cell  2000 May;5(5):865-76

Deletion of TPS1 results in severe hyperaccumulation of sugar phosphates and near absence of ethanol formation. To investigate whether trehalose 6-phosphate (Tre6P) is the sole mediator of hexokinase inhibition, we have reconstituted ethanolic fermentation from glucose in permeabilized spheroplasts of the wild-type, tps1Delta and tps2Delta (Tre6P phosphatase) strains. For the tps1Delta strain, ethanol production was significantly lower and was associated with hyperaccumulation of Glu6P and Fru6P. A tps2Delta strain shows reduced accumulation of Glu6P and Fru6P both in intact cells and in permeabilized spheroplasts. These results are not consistent with Tre6P being the sole mediator of hexokinase inhibition. Reconstitution of ethanolic fermentation in permeabilized spheroplasts with glycolytic intermediates indicates additional target site(s) for the Tps1 control. Addition of Tre6P partially shifts the ethanol production rate and the metabolite pattern in permeabilized tps1Delta spheroplasts to those of the wild-type strain, but only with glucose as substrate. This is observed at a very high ratio of glucose to Tre6P. Inhibition of hexokinase activity by Tre6P is less efficiently counteracted by glucose in permeabilized spheroplasts compared to cell extracts, and this effect is largely abolished by deletion of TPS2 but not TPS1. In permeabilized spheroplasts, hexokinase activity is significantly lower in a tps2Delta strain compared to a wild-type strain and this difference is strongly reduced by additional deletion of TPS1. These results indicate that Tps1-mediated protein-protein interactions are important for control of glucose influx into yeast glycolysis, that Tre6P inhibition of hexokinase might not be competitive with respect to glucose in vivo and that also Tps2 appears to play a role in the control of hexokinase activity.",PMID: 10880982 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,436: Genetics  2000 Jul;155(3):1069-81

By shuffling mutated and wild-type domains of URE2, we also created the first mutant Ure2 protein that is functional and induces prion formation. We demonstrate that the domains of URE2 function synergistically in cis to induce [URE3] formation, which highlights the importance of intramolecular interactions in Ure2p folding.

A major form of pol epsilon purified from yeast consists of at least four subunits: Pol2p, Dpb2p, Dpb3p, and Dpb4p. We have investigated the protein/protein interactions between these polypeptides by using expression of individual subunits in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells and by using the yeast two-hybrid assay. The essential subunits, Pol2p and Dpb2p, interact directly in the absence of the other two subunits, and the C-terminal half of POL2, the only essential portion of Pol2p, is sufficient for interaction with Dpb2p. Dpb3p and Dpb4p, non-essential subunits, also interact directly with each other in the absence of the other two subunits. We propose that Pol2p.Dpb2p and Dpb3p.Dpb4p complexes interact with each other and document several interactions between individual members of the two respective complexes. We present biochemical evidence to support the proposal that pol epsilon may be dimeric in vivo. Gel filtration of the Pol2p.Dpb2p complexes reveals a novel heterotetrameric form, consisting of two heterodimers of Pol2p.Dpb2p. Dpb2p, but not Pol2p, exists as a homodimer, and thus the Pol2p dimerization may be mediated by Dpb2p. The pol2-E and pol2-F mutations that cause replication defects in vivo weaken the interaction between Pol2p and Dpb2p and also reduce dimerization of Pol2p.

To investigate whether specific interactions between the receptor and the G protein occur prior to ligand binding, we analyzed dominant-negative mutant receptors that compete with wild-type receptors for G proteins, and we analyzed the ability of receptors to suppress the constitutive signaling activity of mutant Galpha subunits in an alpha-factor-independent manner. Although the amino acid substitution L236H in the third intracellular loop of the receptor impairs G-protein activation, this substitution had no influence on the ability of the dominant-negative receptors to sequester G proteins or on the ability of receptors to suppress the GPA1-A345T mutant Galpha subunit. In contrast, removal of the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of the receptor eliminated both of these activities even though the C-terminal domain is unnecessary for G-protein activation. Moreover, the alpha-factor-independent signaling activity of ste2-P258L mutant receptors was inhibited by the coexpression of wild-type receptors but not by coexpression of truncated receptors lacking the C-terminal domain. Deletion analysis suggested that the distal half of the C-terminal domain is critical for sequestration of G proteins. The C-terminal domain was also found to influence the affinity of the receptor for alpha-factor in cells lacking G proteins.

Yeast express two functional HMG-CoA reductase isozymes, Hmg1p and Hmg2p, each of which induces morphologically different ER arrays. Hmg1p induces stacks of paired nuclear-associated membranes called karmellae. In contrast, Hmg2p induces peripheral ER membrane arrays and short nuclear-associated membrane stacks. In spite of their ability to induce different cellular responses, both Hmg1p and Hmg2p have similar structures, including a polytopic membrane domain containing eight predicted transmembrane helices. By examining a series of recombinant HMG-CoA reductase proteins, our laboratory previously demonstrated that the last ER-lumenal loop (Loop G) of the Hmg1p membrane domain contains a signal needed for proper karmellae assembly. Our goal was to examine the primary sequence requirements within Loop G that were critical for proper function of this signal. To this end, we randomly mutagenized the Loop G sequence, expressed the mutagenized Hmg1p in yeast, and screened for inability to generate karmellae at wild-type levels. Out of approximately 4000 strains with Loop G mutations, we isolated 57 that were unable to induce wild-type levels of karmellae assembly. Twenty-nine of these mutants contained one or more point mutations in the Loop G sequence, including nine single point mutants, four of which had severe defects in karmellae assembly. Comparison of these mutations to single point mutations that did not affect karmellae assembly did not reveal obvious patterns of sequence requirements. For example, both conservative and non-conservative changes were present in both groups and changes that altered the total charge of the Loop G region were observed in both groups.

As shown previously for plant 14-3-3s, fluorescent probes also indicated that yeast BMH2 interacted directly with cations, which bind and affect surface hydrophobicity. Binding of 14-3-3s to the phosphopeptide ligand occurred in the absence of divalent cations when the pH was reduced below neutral, and the basis for enhanced binding was a reduction in K(D). At pH 7.5 (+Mg2+), AMP inhibited binding of plant 14-3-3s to the NR based peptide ligand. The binding of AMP to 14-3-3s was directly demonstrated by equilibrium dialysis (plant), and from the observation that recombinant plant 14-3-3s have a low, but detectable, AMP phosphatase activity.",PMID: 10845467 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

A new random saturation mutagenesis method was developed to isolate Gcn4p derivatives with only one or two mutations in the DNA binding domain without using radioactive isotope. This will be used to identify the amino acids of Gcn4p involved in protein-protein interactions. Saturation mutagenesis in the DNA binding domain of Gcn4p was performed using spiked degenerate oligonucleotides containing randomized codon bases designed specifically for only one or two base changes in the mutagenized area. These oligonucleotides were synthesized to have two flanking restriction enzyme sites for cloning to the appropriate vector. The 3' ends were mutually primed after hybridization via the palindromic sequences of the restriction enzyme sites. These molecules were then converted to double stranded DNA upon treatment with DNA polymerase. Here, a library collection of 100,680 in an altered Gcn4p pool was generated by cloning a mixed-base oligonucleotide in the place of the sequence coding for the DNA binding domains. The quality of the library was examined by DNA sequencing and found to be in good agreement with the expected statistical values. Calculated mutation frequency was 66% of mutant nucleotide rate and actual sequencing data revealed 68% mutant nucleotide rates from the sequenced library. Thus, among 21 mutants, 16 had one point mutations and 5 had two point mutations. This approach appears to be an effective and general tool for creating proteins with one or two amino acid change(s) in their molecules.",PMID: 10850667 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

Overproduction of either the meiotic chromosomal protein Red1 or the meiotic kinase Mek1 bypasses this checkpoint, allowing zip1 cells to sporulate. Red1 or Mek1 overproduction also promotes sporulation of other mutants (zip2, dmc1, hop2) that undergo checkpoint-mediated arrest at pachytene. In addition, Red1 overproduction antagonizes interhomolog interactions in the zip1 mutant, substantially decreasing double-strand break formation, meiotic recombination, and homologous chromosome pairing. Mek1 overproduction, in contrast, suppresses checkpoint-induced arrest without significantly decreasing meiotic recombination. Cooverproduction of Red1 and Mek1 fails to bypass the checkpoint; moreover, overproduction of the meiotic chromosomal protein Hop1 blocks the Red1 and Mek1 overproduction phenotypes. These results suggest that meiotic chromosomal proteins function in the signaling of meiotic prophase defects and that the correct stoichiometry of Red1, Mek1, and Hop1 is needed to achieve checkpoint-mediated cell cycle arrest at pachytene.",PMID: 10848609 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

Previous studies have indicated that UNC-86 and MEC-3 bind cooperatively to at least three sites in the mec-3 promoter and synergistically activate transcription. However, the molecular details of the interactions of UNC-86 with MEC-3 and DNA have not been investigated so far. Here we used a yeast system to identify the functional domains in UNC-86 required for transcriptional activation and to characterize the interaction of UNC-86 with MEC-3 in vivo. Our results suggest that transcriptional activation is mediated by the amino terminus of UNC-86, whereas amino acids in the POU domain mediate DNA binding and interaction with MEC-3. By random mutagenesis, we identified mutations that only affect the DNA binding properties of UNC-86, as well as mutations that prevent coactivation by MEC-3. We demonstrated that both the POU-specific domain and the homeodomain of UNC-86, as well as DNA bases adjacent to the proposed UNC-86 binding site, are involved in the formation of a transcriptionally active complex with MEC-3. These data suggest that some residues involved in the contact of UNC-86 with MEC-3 also contribute to the interaction of the functionally nonrelated POU protein Oct-1 with Oca-B, whereas other positions have different roles.",PMID: 10848606 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

We therefore tried to characterize the MR A/B domain as the AF-1 and further studied the actions of known coactivators for AF-2 in the E/F ligand-binding domain in the function of the MR A/B domain. Deletion analyses of rat and human MRs revealed that the A/B domains harbor a transactivation function acting as AF-1. The MR mutant (E959Q) with a point mutation in helix 12, which causes a complete loss of MR AF-2 activity, still retained ligand-induced transactivation function, indicating a significant role for AF-1 in the full activity of the ligand-induced MR function.

However, such interactions were undetectable in a yeast and in an in vitro glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assay, indicating that the functional interaction of TIF2 and p300 with the MR A/B domain to support the MR AF-1 activity require some unknown nuclear factor(s) or a proper modification of the A/B domain in the cells.",PMID: 10847590 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

Recent studies indicate that both types of enzymes can be recruited to chromosomal loci through either physical interactions with transcriptional activators or via the global accessibility of chromatin during S phase of the cell cycle.

"The spindle checkpoint delays the metaphase to anaphase transition in response to defects in kinetochore-microtubule interactions in the mitotic apparatus (see [1] [2] [3] [4] for reviews). The Mad and Bub proteins were identified as key components of the spindle checkpoint through budding yeast genetics [5] [6] and are highly conserved [3]. Most of the spindle checkpoint proteins have been localised to kinetochores, yet almost nothing is known about the molecular events which take place there. Mad1p forms a tight complex with Mad2p [7], and has been shown to recruit Mad2p to kinetochores [8]. Similarly, Bub3p binds to Bub1p [9] and may target it to kinetochores [10]. Here, we show that budding yeast Mad1p has a regulated association with Bub1p and Bub3p during a normal cell cycle and that this complex is found at significantly higher levels once the spindle checkpoint is activated. We find that formation of this complex requires Mad2p and Mps1p but not Mad3p or Bub2p. In addition, we identify a conserved motif within Mad1p that is essential for Mad1p-Bub1p-Bub3p complex formation. Mutation of this motif abolishes checkpoint function, indicating that formation of the Mad1p-Bub1p-Bub3p complex is a crucial step in the spindle checkpoint mechanism.",PMID: 10837255 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,466: EMBO J  2000 Jun 1;19(11):2515-24 ,"Membrane hyperpolarization and salt sensitivity induced by deletion of PMP3, a highly conserved small protein of yeast plasma membrane."
"Yeast plasma membranes contain a small 55 amino acid hydrophobic polypeptide, Pmp3p, which has high sequence similarity to a novel family of plant polypeptides that are overexpressed under high salt concentration or low temperature treatment. The PMP3 gene is not essential under normal growth conditions. However, its deletion increases the plasma membrane potential and confers sensitivity to cytotoxic cations, such as Na(+) and hygromycin B. Interestingly, the disruption of PMP3 exacerbates the NaCl sensitivity phenotype of a mutant strain lacking the Pmr2p/Enap Na(+)-ATPases and the Nha1p Na(+)/H(+) antiporter, and suppresses the potassium dependency of a strain lacking the K(+) transporters, Trk1p and Trk2p. All these phenotypes could be reversed by the addition of high Ca(2+) concentration to the medium. These genetic interactions indicate that the major effect of the PMP3 deletion is a hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane potential that probably promotes a non-specific influx of monovalent cations. Expression of plant RCI2A in yeast could substitute for the loss of Pmp3p, indicating a common role for Pmp3p and the plant homologue.",PMID: 10835350 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,467: Mol Cell Biol  2000 Jun;20(12):4199-209 ,Two regulators of Ste12p inhibit pheromone-responsive transcription by separate mechanisms.
"The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor Ste12p is responsible for activating genes in response to MAP kinase cascades controlling mating and filamentous growth. Ste12p is negatively regulated by two inhibitor proteins, Dig1p (also called Rst1p) and Dig2p (also called Rst2p). The expression of a C-terminal Ste12p fragment (residues 216 to 688) [Ste12p(216-688)] from a GAL promoter causes FUS1 induction in a strain expressing wild-type STE12, suggesting that this region can cause the activation of endogenous Ste12p. Residues 262 to 594 are sufficient to cause STE12-dependent FUS1 induction when overexpressed, and this region of Ste12p was found to bind Dig1p but not Dig2p in yeast extracts. In contrast, recombinant glutathione S-transferase-Dig2p binds to the Ste12p DNA-binding domain (DBD). Expression of DIG2, but not DIG1, from a GAL promoter inhibits transcriptional activation by an Ste12p DBD-VP16 fusion. Furthermore, disruption of dig1, but not dig2, causes elevated transcriptional activation by a LexA-Ste12p(216-688) fusion. Ste12p has multiple regions within the C terminus (flanking residue 474) that can promote multimerization in vitro, and we demonstrate that these interactions can contribute to the activation of endogenous Ste12p by overproduced C-terminal fragments. These results demonstrate that Dig1p and Dig2p do not function by redundant mechanisms but rather inhibit pheromone-responsive transcription through interactions with separate regions of Ste12p.",PMID: 10825185 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,468: J Biol Chem  2000 Aug 11;275(32):24928-34 ,"The yeast histone acetyltransferase A2 complex, but not free Gcn5p, binds stably to nucleosomal arrays."
"We have investigated the structural basis for the differential catalytic function of the yeast Gcn5p-containing histone acetyltransferase (HAT) A2 complex and free recombinant yeast Gcn5p (rGcn5p). HAT A2 is shown to be a unique complex that contains Gcn5p, Ada2p, and Ada3p, but not proteins specific to other related HAT A complexes, e.g. ADA, SAGA. Nevertheless, HAT A2 produces the same unique polyacetylation pattern of nucleosomal substrates reported previously for ADA and SAGA, demonstrating that proteins specific to the ADA and SAGA complexes do not influence the enzymatic activity of Gcn5p within the HAT A2 complex. To investigate the role of substrate interactions in the differential behavior of free and complexed Gcn5p, sucrose density gradient centrifugation was used to characterize the binding of HAT A2 and free rGcn5p to intact and trypsinized nucleosomal arrays, H3/H4 tetramer arrays, and nucleosome core particles. We find that HAT A2 forms stable complexes with all nucleosomal substrates tested. In distinct contrast, rGcn5p does not interact stably with nucleosomal arrays, despite being able to specifically monoacetylate the H3 N terminus of nucleosomal substrates. Our data suggest that the ability of the HAT A2 complex to bind stably to nucleosomal arrays is functionally related to both local and global acetylation by the complexed and free forms of Gcn5p.",PMID: 10825174 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,469: J Biol Chem  2000 Aug 4;275(31):23500-8 ,Replication protein A physically interacts with the Bloom's syndrome protein and stimulates its helicase activity.
"Bloom's syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by genomic instability and predisposition to cancer. BLM, the gene defective in Bloom's syndrome, encodes a 159-kDa protein possessing DNA-stimulated ATPase and ATP-dependent DNA helicase activities. We have examined mechanistic aspects of the catalytic functions of purified recombinant BLM protein. Through analyzing the effects of different lengths of DNA cofactor on ATPase activity, we provide evidence to suggest that BLM translocates along single-stranded DNA in a processive manner. The helicase reaction catalyzed by BLM protein was examined as a function of duplex DNA length. We show that BLM catalyzes unwinding of short DNA duplexes (</=71 base pairs (bp)) but is severely compromised on longer DNA duplexes (>/=259-bp). The presence of the human single-stranded DNA-binding protein (human replication protein A (hRPA)) stimulates the BLM unwinding reaction on the 259-bp partial duplex DNA substrate. Heterologous single-stranded DNA-binding proteins fail to stimulate similarly the helicase activity of BLM protein. This is the first demonstration of a functional interaction between BLM and another protein. Consistent with a functional interaction between hRPA and the BLM helicase, we demonstrate a direct physical interaction between the two proteins mediated by the 70-kDa subunit of RPA. The interactions between BLM and hRPA suggest that the two proteins function together in vivo to unwind DNA duplexes during replication, recombination, or repair.",PMID: 10825162 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,470: Science  2000 May 19;288(5469):1242-4 ,Distinct classes of yeast promoters revealed by differential TAF recruitment.

Here, the association of TFIID components with promoters that either are dependent on multiple TAFs (TAFdep) or have no apparent TAF requirement (TAFind) is analyzed in yeast. At TAFdep promoters, TAFs are present at levels comparable to that of TBP, whereas at TAFind promoters, TAFs are present at levels that approximate background. After inactivation of several general transcription factors, including TBP, TAFs are still recruited by activators to TAFdep promoters. The results reveal two classes of promoters: at TAFind promoters, TBP is recruited in the apparent absence of TAFs, whereas at TAFdep promoters, TAFs are co-recruited with TBP in a manner consistent with direct activator-TAF interactions.",PMID: 10817999 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,471: J Cell Biol  2000 May 15;149(4):863-74 ,Microtubule interactions with the cell cortex causing nuclear movements in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
"During mitosis in budding yeast the nucleus first moves to the mother-bud neck and then into the neck. Both movements depend on interactions of cytoplasmic microtubules with the cortex. We investigated the mechanism of these movements in living cells using video analysis of GFP-labeled microtubules in wild-type cells and in EB1 and Arp1 mutants, which are defective in the first and second steps, respectively. We found that nuclear movement to the neck is largely mediated by the capture of microtubule ends at one cortical region at the incipient bud site or bud tip, followed by microtubule depolymerization. Efficient microtubule interactions with the capture site require that microtubules be sufficiently long and dynamic to probe the cortex. In contrast, spindle movement into the neck is mediated by microtubule sliding along the bud cortex, which requires dynein and dynactin. Free microtubules can also slide along the cortex of both bud and mother. Capture/shrinkage of microtubule ends also contributes to nuclear movement into the neck and can serve as a backup mechanism to move the nucleus into the neck when microtubule sliding is impaired. Conversely, microtubule sliding can move the nucleus into the neck even when capture/shrinkage is impaired.",PMID: 10811827 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,472: EMBO J  2000 May 15;19(10):2323-31 ,The chromo domain protein chd1p from budding yeast is an ATP-dependent chromatin-modifying factor.
"CHD proteins are members of the chromo domain family, a class of proteins involved in transcription, DNA degradation and chromatin structure. In higher eukaryotes, there are two distinct subfamilies of CHD proteins: CHD1 and CHD3/4. Analyses carried out in vitro indicate that the CHD3/4 proteins may regulate transcription via alteration of chromatin structure. However, little is known about the role of CHD proteins in vivo, particularly the CHD1 subfamily. To understand better the cellular function of CHD proteins, we initiated a study on the Chd1p protein from budding yeast. Using genomic DNA arrays, we identified genes whose expression is affected by the absence of Chd1p. A synthetic-lethal screen uncovered genetic interactions between SWI/SNF genes and CHD1. Biochemical experiments using Chd1p purified from yeast showed that it reconfigures the structure of nucleosome core particles in a manner distinct from the SWI-SNF complex. Taken together, these results suggest that Chd1p functions as a nucleosome remodeling factor, and that Chd1p may share overlapping roles with the SWI-SNF complex to regulate transcription.",PMID: 10811623 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,473: Biochem Pharmacol  2000 Jan 15;59(2):177-85 ,Agonistic and synergistic activity of tamoxifen in a yeast model system.
"The background of agonist/antagonist behaviour of the non-steroidal antiestrogen tamoxifen is still not fully understood. Depending on cell type, its activities range from full agonistic to antagonistic in different tissues. We investigated the transactivational properties of tamoxifen in a basic yeast model system which reconstitutes ligand-dependent human estrogen receptor-alpha (hER alpha) gene activation. Tamoxifen exerted low agonist activity in this system compared to 17 beta-estradiol (E2). Efficiencies and potencies of several isomers were calculated by fitting experimental data with a logistic dose-response function. Cis-, trans- and cis-transtamoxifen and trans-4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) showed comparable efficiencies and potencies in yeast. When subeffective doses of trans-, cis-/trans-, or trans-4-OH tamoxifen were combined with increasing 17 beta-estradiol concentrations, even a synergistic increase in efficiencies could be observed. Interestingly, the cis-isomer did not show this synergistic effect. Mutation of the N-terminus of the estrogen receptor changed the transactivational behaviour of tamoxifen and abolished the synergistic action with 17 beta-estradiol. Except for 4-OHT, the potencies of the investigated isomers, defined as ligand concentrations with half-maximal response, highly correlated with the binding affinities to hER alpha. Therefore, cis-, trans-, and cis-/trans-tamoxifen could be regarded as full agonists in yeast, while 4-OHT was regarded as a partial antagonist in yeast. Furthermore, these results indicate that the functional difference between trans-tamoxifen and trans-4-OHT is not due to their different affinities for the receptor protein.",PMID: 10810452 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,474: J Biol Chem  2000 May 19;275(20):15350-6 ,Intramolecular interactions between the juxtamembrane domain and phosphatase domains of receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase RPTPmu. Regulation of catalytic activity.
"RPTPmu is a receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) whose ectodomain mediates homotypic cell-cell interactions. The intracellular part of RPTPmu contains a relatively long juxtamembrane domain (158 amino acids; aa) and two conserved phosphatase domains (C1 and C2). The membrane-proximal C1 domain is responsible for the catalytic activity of RPTPmu, whereas the membrane-distal C2 domain serves an unknown function. The regulation of RPTP activity remains poorly understood, although dimerization has been proposed as a general mechanism of inactivation. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we find that the C1 domain binds to an N-terminal noncatalytic region in RPTPmu, termed JM (aa 803-955), consisting of a large part of the juxtamembrane domain (120 aa) and a small part of the C1 domain (33 aa). When co-expressed in COS cells, the JM polypeptide binds to both the C1 and the C2 domain. Strikingly, the isolated JM polypeptide fails to interact with either full-length RPTPmu or with truncated versions of RPTPmu that contain the JM region, consistent with the JM-C1 and JM-C2 interactions being intramolecular rather than intermolecular. Furthermore, we find that large part of the juxtamembrane domain (aa 814-922) is essential for C1 to be catalytically active. Our findings suggest a model in which RPTPmu activity is regulated by the juxtamembrane domain undergoing intramolecular interactions with both the C1 and C2 domain.",PMID: 10809770 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,475: J Biol Chem  2000 May 19;275(20):14979-84 ,Peptides selected to bind the Gal80 repressor are potent transcriptional activation domains in yeast.
"The activation domain of the yeast Gal4 protein binds specifically to the Gal80 repressor and is also thought to associate with one or more coactivators in the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme and chromatin remodeling machines. This is a specific example of a common situation in biochemistry where a single protein domain can interact with multiple partners. Are these different interactions related chemically? To probe this point, phage display was employed to isolate peptides from a library based solely on their ability to bind Gal80 protein in vitro. Peptide-Gal80 protein association is shown to be highly specific and of moderate affinity. The Gal80 protein-binding peptides compete with the native activation domain for the repressor, suggesting that they bind to the same site. It was then asked if these peptides could function as activation domains in yeast when tethered to a DNA binding domain. Indeed, this is the case. Furthermore, one of the Gal80-binding peptides binds directly to a domain of the Gal11 protein, a known coactivator. The fact that Gal80-binding peptides are functional activation domains argues that repressor binding and activation/coactivator binding are intimately related properties. This peptide library-based approach should be generally useful for probing the chemical relationship of different binding interactions or functions of a given native domain.",PMID: 10809742 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,476: Mol Endocrinol  2000 May;14(5):718-32 ,GCN5 and ADA adaptor proteins regulate triiodothyronine/GRIP1 and SRC-1 coactivator-dependent gene activation by the human thyroid hormone receptor.
"We have used yeast genetics and in vitro protein-protein interaction experiments to explore the possibility that GCN5 (general control nonrepressed protein 5) and several other ADA (alteration/deficiency in activation) adaptor proteins of the multimeric SAGA complex can regulate T3/GRIP1 (glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1) and SRC-1 (steroid receptor coactivator-1) coactivator-dependent activation of transcription by the human T3 receptor beta1 (hTRbeta1). Here, we show that in vivo activation of a T3/GRIP1 or SRC-1 coactivator-dependent T3 hormone response element by hTRbeta1 is dependent upon the presence of yeast GCN5, ADA2, ADA1, or ADA3 adaptor proteins and that the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domains and bromodomain (BrD) of yGCN5 must be intact for maximal activation of transcription. We also observed that hTRbeta1 can bind directly to yeast or human GCN5 as well as hADA2, and that the hGCN5(387-837) sequence could bind directly to either GRIP1 or SRC-1 coactivator. Importantly, the T3-dependent binding of hTRbeta1 to hGCN5(387-837) could be markedly increased by the presence of GRIP1 or SRC1. Mutagenesis of GRIP1 nuclear receptor (NR) Box II and III LXXLL motifs also substantially decreased both in vivo activation of transcription and in vitro T3-dependent binding of hTRbeta1 to hGCN5. Taken together, these experiments support a multistep model of transcriptional initiation wherein the binding of T3 to hTRbeta1 initiates the recruitment of p160 coactivators and GCN5 to form a trimeric transcriptional complex that activates target genes through interactions with ADA/SAGA adaptor proteins and nucleosomal histones.",PMID: 10809234 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,477: Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A  2000 May 9;97(10):5267-72 ,Distinct roles of the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of the protein inhibitor of activated signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 (PIAS1) in cytokine-induced PIAS1-Stat1 interaction.
"STATs are activated by tyrosine phosphorylation on cytokine stimulation. A tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT forms a functional dimer through reciprocal Src homology 2 domain (SH2)-phosphotyrosyl peptide interactions. IFN treatment induces the association of PIAS1 and Stat1, which results in the inhibition of Stat1-mediated gene activation. The molecular basis of the cytokine-dependent PIAS1-Stat1 interaction has not been understood. We report here that a region near the COOH terminus of PIAS1 (amino acids 392-541) directly interacts with the NH(2)-terminal domain of Stat1 (amino acids 1-191). A mutant PIAS1 lacking the Stat1-interacting domain failed to inhibit Stat1-mediated gene activation. By using a modified yeast two-hybrid assay, we demonstrated that PIAS1 specifically interacts with the Stat1 dimer, but not tyrosine-phosphorylated or -unphosphorylated Stat1 monomer. In addition, whereas the NH(2)-terminal region of PIAS1 does not interact with Stat1, it serves as a modulatory domain by preventing the interaction of the COOH-terminal domain of PIAS1 with the Stat1 monomer. Thus, the cytokine-induced PIAS1-Stat1 interaction is mediated through the specific recognition of the dimeric form of Stat1 by PIAS1.",PMID: 10805787 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,478: Mol Cell Biol  2000 Jun;20(11):3965-76 ,Identification of domains and residues within the epsilon subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2Bepsilon) required for guanine nucleotide exchange reveals a novel activation function promoted by eIF2B complex formation.
"Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for protein synthesis initiation factor 2 (eIF2). Composed of five subunits, it converts eIF2 from a GDP-bound form to the active eIF2-GTP complex. This is a regulatory step of translation initiation. In vitro, eIF2B catalytic function can be provided by the largest (epsilon) subunit alone (eIF2Bepsilon). This activity is stimulated by complex formation with the other eIF2B subunits. We have analyzed the roles of different regions of eIF2Bepsilon in catalysis, in eIF2B complex formation, and in binding to eIF2 by characterizing mutations in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene encoding eIF2Bepsilon (GCD6) that impair the essential function of eIF2B. Our analysis of nonsense mutations indicates that the C terminus of eIF2Bepsilon (residues 518 to 712) is required for both catalytic activity and interaction with eIF2. In addition, missense mutations within this region impair the catalytic activity of eIF2Bepsilon without affecting its ability to bind eIF2. Internal, in-frame deletions within the N-terminal half of eIF2Bepsilon disrupt eIF2B complex formation without affecting the nucleotide exchange activity of eIF2Bepsilon alone. Finally, missense mutations identified within this region do not affect the catalytic activity of eIF2Bepsilon alone or its interactions with the other eIF2B subunits or with eIF2. Instead, these missense mutations act indirectly by impairing the enhancement of the rate of nucleotide exchange that results from complex formation between eIF2Bepsilon and the other eIF2B subunits. This suggests that the N-terminal region of eIF2Bepsilon is an activation domain that responds to eIF2B complex formation.",PMID: 10805739 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,479: Nat Struct Biol  2000 May;7(5):375-9 ,Structural analysis of WW domains and design of a WW prototype.
"Two new NMR structures of WW domains, the mouse formin binding protein and a putative 84.5 kDa protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, show that this domain, only 35 amino acids in length, defines the smallest monomeric triple-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet protein domain that is stable in the absence of disulfide bonds, tightly bound ions or ligands. The structural roles of conserved residues have been studied using site-directed mutagenesis of both wild type domains. Crucial interactions responsible for the stability of the WW structure have been identified. Based on a network of highly conserved long range interactions across the beta-sheet structure that supports the WW fold and on a systematic analysis of conserved residues in the WW family, we have designed a folded prototype WW sequence.",PMID: 10802733 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,480: J Biol Chem  2000 Jul 21;275(29):22470-8 ,An actin subdomain 2 mutation that impairs thin filament regulation by troponin and tropomyosin.
"Striated muscle thin filaments adopt different quaternary structures, depending upon calcium binding to troponin and myosin binding to actin. Modification of actin subdomain 2 alters troponin-tropomyosin-mediated regulation, suggesting that this region of actin may contain important protein-protein interaction sites. We used yeast actin mutant D56A/E57A to examine this issue. The mutation increased the affinity of tropomyosin for actin 3-fold. The addition of Ca(2+) to mutant actin filaments containing troponin-tropomyosin produced little increase in the thin filament-myosin S1 MgATPase rate. Despite this, three-dimensional reconstruction of electron microscope images of filaments in the presence of troponin and Ca(2+) showed tropomyosin to be in a position similar to that found for muscle actin filaments, where most of the myosin binding site is exposed. Troponin-tropomyosin bound with comparable affinity to mutant and wild type actin in the absence and presence of calcium, and in the presence of myosin S1, tropomyosin bound very tightly to both types of actin. The mutation decreased actin-myosin S1 affinity 13-fold in the presence of troponin-tropomyosin and 2.6-fold in the absence of the regulatory proteins. The results suggest the importance of negatively charged actin subdomain 2 residues 56 and 57 for myosin binding to actin, for tropomyosin-actin interactions, and for regulatory conformational changes in the actin-troponin-tropomyosin complex.",PMID: 10801864 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,481: Curr Opin Cell Biol  2000 Jun;12(3):361-71 ,The nuclear pore complex: a protein machine bridging the nucleus and cytoplasm.

HSF isolated from stressed cells displays a higher propensity to adopt this altered conformation. Purified HSF can be stimulated in vitro to undergo the conformational change by elevating the temperature or by exposing HSF to superoxide anion. Mutational analysis maps a region critical for this conformational change to the flexible loop between the minimal DNA-binding domain and the flexible linker that joins the DNA-binding domain to the trimerization domain.

No growth defect was observed when PRA2 was expressed in the wild-type yeast cells. Unlike the case of Ara4, neither Arabidopsis nor yeast GDI remedied the growth defect by Pra2, indicating that the mechanism of the exacerbation is different.

However, null alleles of PPZ1 and PPZ2, in combination with mutant alleles of GLC7, confer a range of growth defects varying from slow growth to lethality.

TAP has also been implicated in the export of simian type D viral RNAs bearing the constitutive transport element (CTE). Although TAP directly interacts with CTE-bearing RNAs, the mode of interaction of TAP/Mex67p with cellular mRNAs is different from that with the CTE RNA and is likely to be mediated by protein-protein interactions. Here we show that Mex67p directly interacts with Yra1p, an essential yeast hnRNP-like protein. This interaction is evolutionarily conserved as Yra1p also interacts with TAP. Conditional expression in yeast cells implicates Yra1 p in the export of cellular mRNAs. Database searches revealed that Yra1p belongs to an evolutionarily conserved family of hnRNP-like proteins having more than one member in Mus musculus, Xenopus laevis, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe and at least one member in several species including plants. The murine members of the family directly interact with TAP. Because members of this protein family are characterized by the presence of one RNP-motif RNA-binding domain and exhibit RNA-binding activity, we called these proteins REF-bps for RNA and export factor binding proteins.

Disruption of the sasA gene lowered kaiBC expression and dramatically reduced amplitude of the kai expression rhythms while shortening the period. Accordingly, sasA disruption attenuated circadian expression patterns of all tested genes, some of which became arrhythmic.

Localized in the inner membrane of the organelle, they are postulated to be regulators of mitochondrial uncoupling. UCP2 and 3 may play an important role in the regulation of thermogenesis and, thus, on the resting metabolic rate in humans. To identify interacting proteins that may be involved in the regulation of the activity of UCPs, the yeast two-hybrid system was applied. Segments of hUCP2 containing the hydrophilic loops facing the intermembrane space, or combinations of these, were used to screen an adipocyte activation domain (AD) fusion library. The 14.3.3 protein isoforms theta, beta, zeta were identified as possible interacting partners of hUCP2. Screening of a human skeletal muscle AD fusion library, on the other hand, yielded several clones all of them encoding the gamma isoform of the 14.3.3 family. Mapping experiments further revealed that all these 14.3.3 proteins interact specifically with the C-terminal intermembrane space domain of both hUCP2 and hUCP3 whereas no interactions could be detected with the C-terminal part of hUCP1. Direct interaction between UCP3 and 14.3.3 theta could be demonstrated after in vitro translation by coimmunoprecipitation.

The amino-terminal half of Rsp5 consists of four domains: a C2 domain, which binds membrane phospholipids; and three WW domains, which are protein interaction modules that bind proline-rich ligands. The carboxyl-terminal half of Rsp5 contains a HECT (homologous to E6-AP carboxyl terminus) domain that catalytically ligates ubiquitin to proteins and functionally classifies Rsp5 as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. The C2 and WW domains are presumed to act as membrane localization and substrate recognition modules, respectively. We report that the second (and possibly third) Rsp5 WW domain mediates binding to the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA pol II large subunit. The CTD comprises a heptamer (YSPTSPS) repeated 26 times and a PXY core that is critical for interaction with a specific group of WW domains. An analysis of synthetic peptides revealed a minimal CTD sequence that is sufficient to bind to the second Rsp5 WW domain (Rsp5 WW2) in vitro and in yeast two-hybrid assays. Furthermore, we found that specific ""imperfect"" CTD repeats can form a complex with Rsp5 WW2.

Pat1p contributes to the efficiency of translation in a yeast cell-free system. However, the synergy between the cap structure and the poly(A) tail is maintained in vitro in the absence of Pat1p. Analysis of translation initiation intermediates on gradients indicates that Pat1p acts at a step before or during the recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit by the mRNA, a step which may be independent of that involving Pab1p.

Assembly and function of the enzyme is a complicated task requiring the interactions of many proteins for the folding, import, assembly, and function of the enzyme. The F1-ATPase is a multimeric enzyme composed of five subunits in the stoichiometry of alpha3beta3gammadeltaepsilon. This study demonstrates that four of the five bovine subunits of the F1-ATPase can be imported and function in an otherwise yeast enzyme effectively complementing mutations in the genes encoding the corresponding yeast ATPase subunits. In order to demonstrate this, the coding regions of each of the five genes were separately deleted in yeast providing five null mutant strains. All of the strains displayed negative or a slow growth phenotype on medium containing glycerol as the carbon source and strains with a null mutation in the gene encoding the gamma-, delta- or epsilon-gene became completely, or at a high frequency, cytoplasmically petite. The subunits of bovine F1 were expressed individually in the yeast strains with the corresponding null mutations and targeted to the mitochondrion using a yeast mitochondrial leader peptide. Expression of the bovine alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and epsilon-, but not the delta-, subunit complemented the corresponding null mutations in yeast correcting the corresponding negative phenotypes. These results indicate that yeast is able to import, assemble subunits of bovine F1-ATPase in mitochondria and form a functional chimeric yeast/bovine enzyme complex.",PMID: 10759867 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,501: Plant J  2000 Feb;21(4):379-85

Mutational analysis of ARA4 indicated that the Ara4 protein titrates at least three factors in yeast, including the GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI). The coexpression of AtGDI1 (Arabidopsis GDI) suppressed the growth defect caused by Ara4 in yeast ypt1, suggesting that Ara4 and AtGDI1 interact in yeast to compensate for the titration of yeast GDI. We screened an Arabidopsis cDNA library for other suppressors that may also interact with Ara4 physiologically. A novel suppressor, SAY1, encoded a hydrophilic protein with two putative coiled-coil regions, which showed partial similarity to the yeast Vps27 protein. To understand the structural requirements of Ara4 for interacting with these molecules, we examined whether AtGDI1 and SAY1 could suppress the growth defect of ypt1 caused by various mutant versions of ARA4. The results indicated that the interaction between Ara4 and AtGDI1 depends on the conserved C-terminal Cys-motif and Thr44 in the effector domain of Ara4. In contrast, neither of these motifs is necessary for the interaction between Say1 and Ara4.

The present work describes a simple method by which internalized and surface-bound yeast particles can be identified by differential interference contrast microscopy, using trypan blue to stain surface-bound yeast particles. The method has the advantage that both internalized and surface-bound particles can be visualized without the need to switch the illumination source and/or filter sets, thus facilitating concurrent quantitation of binding and internalization. The method was evaluated with the phagocytosis-modulating agents horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and cytochalasin D, using adherent resident macrophages as phagocytic cells. When macrophages are challenged with a particular type of target, they usually bind many more targets than they ingest. It was shown that yeast particles were arrested in the initial binding phase of phagocytosis depending on the region of macrophage plasma membrane where binding sites were formed. Failure of surface-bound yeast particles to trigger internalization was not due to modifications of the yeast particle surface. Nor was it due to binding to non-phagocytic receptors, or low-affinity receptor-ligand interactions. The glycoprotein HRP inhibited only the binding stage of phagocytosis, whereas cytochalasin D, a drug that affects actin polymerization, inhibited both binding and internalization. However, when the yeast particles were pre-incubated in fresh mouse serum, cytochalasin D inhibited only the internalization step. The assay described here may be useful in studies concerned with the function and expression of phagocytosis-mediating surface lectins.",PMID: 10758233 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,504: J Chromatogr A  2000 Mar 24;873(2):195-208 
"Institut fur Enzymtechnologie, Heinrich-Heine Universitat Dusseldorf, Julich, Germany.","Expanded bed adsorption (EBA) is a primary recovery operation allowing the adsorption of proteins directly from unclarified feedstock, e.g. culture suspensions, homogenates or crude extracts. Thus solid-liquid separation is combined with adsorptive purification in a single step. The concept of integration requires that the solid components of the feed solution are regarded as a part of the process, which influences stability, reproducibility, and overall performance. This aspect is investigated here at the example of the influence of presence and concentration of intact yeast cells (S. cerevisiae) on the adsorption of model proteins (hen egg white lysozyme and bovine serum albumin) to various stationary phases (cation and anion-exchange, hydrophobic interaction, immobilised metal affinity). The interaction of the cells with the adsorbents is determined qualitatively and quantitatively by a pulse response method as well as by a finite bath technique under different operating conditions. The consequence of these interactions for the stability of expanded beds in suspensions of varying cell concentration is measured by residence time distributions (RTDs) after tracer pulse injection (NaBr, LiCl). Analysis of the measured RTD by the PDE model allows the calculation of the fraction of perfectly fluidised bed (phi), a parameter which may be regarded as a critical quantity for the estimation of the quality of fluidisation of adsorbents in cell containing suspensions. The correlation between bed stability and performance is made by analysing the breakthrough of model proteins during adsorption from unclarified yeast culture broth. A clear relationship is found between the degree of cell/adsorbent interaction, bed stability in terms of the phi parameter, and the sorption efficiency. Only beds characterised by a phi value larger than 0.8 in the presence of cells will show a conserved performance compared to adsorption from cell free solutions. A drop in phi, which is due to interactions of the fluidised adsorbent particles with cells from the feed, will directly result in a reduced breakthrough efficiency. The data presented highlight the importance of including the potential interaction of solid feedstock components and the expanded adsorbents into the design of EBA processes, as the interrelation found here is a key factor for the overall performance of EBA as a truly integrated operation.",PMID: 10757297 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,505: J Mol Biol  2000 Apr 21;298(1):111-21

No other interactions, including self-interactions, were found, indicating that the observed interactions are specific. The yeast Rad51 interacts with human Rad51 and XRCC3, suggesting Rad51 conservation since the human yeast divergence.

The importance of HBX in the life cycle of HBV has been well established, but the underlying molecular function of HBX remains controversial. We previously identified a proteasome subunit PSMA7 that interacts specifically with HBX in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae two-hybrid system. Here we demonstrate that PSMC1, an ATPase-like subunit of the 19 S proteasome component, also interacts with HBX and PSMA7. Analysis of the interacting domains among PSMA7, PSMC1, and HBX by deletion and site-directed mutagenesis suggested a mutually competitive structural relationship among these polypeptides. The competitive nature of these interactions is further demonstrated using a modified yeast two-hybrid dissociator system. The crucial HBX sequences involved in interaction with PSMA7 and PSMC1 are important for its function as a transcriptional coactivator. HBX, while functioning as a coactivator of AP-1 and acidic activator VP-16 in mammalian cells, had no effect on the transactivation function of their functional orthologs GCN4 and Gal4 in yeast. Overexpression of PSMC1 seemed to suppress the expression of various reporters in mammalian cells; this effect, however, was overcome by coexpression of HBX. In addition, HBX expression inhibited the cellular turnover of c-Jun and ubiquitin-Arg-beta-galactosidase, two well known substrates of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Thus, interaction of HBX with the proteasome complex in metazoan cells may underlie the functional basis of proteasome as a cellular target of HBX.",PMID: 10748218 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,509: J Biol Chem  2000 Jul 21;275(29):22255-67

The results are consistent with the domain organization of the Flp protein and with the general features of the protein-DNA interactions revealed by the crystal structures of the recombination intermediates formed by Cre, the Flp-related recombinase. The similarity in the organization of the Flp and Cre target sites and in their recognition by the respective recombinases implies that the overall DNA-protein geometry during strand cleavage in the two systems must also be similar. Within the functional recombinase dimer, it is the interaction between two recombinase monomers bound on either side of the strand exchange region (or spacer) that provides the allosteric activation of a single active site. Whereas Cre utilizes the cleavage nucleophile (the active site tyrosine) in cis, Flp utilizes it in trans (one monomer donating the tyrosine to its partner). By using synthetic Cre and Flp DNA substrates that are geometrically restricted in similar ways, we have mapped the positioning of the active and inactive tyrosine residues during cis and trans cleavage events. We find that, for a fixed substrate geometry, Flp and Cre cleave the labile phosphodiester bond at the same spacer end, not at opposite ends.

Although the regulation of the PLC-betas by GPCRs and heterotrimeric G proteins has been extensively studied, little is known about the molecular determinants that regulate their activity. The PLC-beta isozymes carry a putative PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) binding motif (X(S/T)X(V/L)COOH) at their carboxyl terminus, which is implicated in specific interactions with anchor proteins. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor 2 (NHERF2) as a protein that interacted with a C-terminal heptapeptide of PLC-beta3. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that NHERF2 interacts specifically with PLC-beta3, but not with other PLC-beta isotypes. Furthermore, PLC-beta3 interacted with NHERF2 rather than with other PDZ-containing proteins. This interaction required the COOH-terminal NTQL sequence of PLC-beta3 and the second PDZ domain of NHERF2. Interestingly, NHERF2 potentiated the PLC-beta activation by carbachol in COS7 and HeLa cells, while mutant NHERF2, lacking the second PDZ domain, had no such effect.

Two of these putative structural modules have been tested in different combinations with regard to transactivation potential in vivo and binding capacity to the coactivators in vitro. The results show that whereas single modules are not transcriptionally active, any combination of two or three modules is sufficient, with trimodular constructs having the highest activity. However, proteins containing one, two, or three segments bind Ada2 and cAMP-response element-binding protein with similar affinity. A single segment is thus able to bind a target factor but cannot transactivate target genes significantly. The results are consistent with models in which activation domains are comprised of short activation modules that allow multiple interactions with coactivators. Our results also suggest that an increased number of modules may not result in correspondingly higher affinity but instead that the concentration of binding sites is increased, which gives rise to a higher association rate.

An approximately 100 residue region of sequence homology at the N-termini of Mbp1 and Swi4 is necessary but not sufficient for full DNA binding activity. Unexpectedly, nonconserved residues C-terminal to the core domain are essential for DNA binding. Proteolysis of Mbp1 and Swi4 DNA-protein complexes has revealed the extent of these sequences, and C-terminally extended molecules with substantially enhanced DNA binding activity compared to the core domains alone have been produced. The extended Mbp1 and Swi4 proteins bind to their cognate sites with similar affinity [K(A) approximately (1-4) x 10(6) M(-)(1)] and with a 1:1 stoichiometry. However, alanine substitution of two lysine residues (116 and 122) within the C-terminal extension (tail) of Mbp1 considerably reduces the apparent affinity for an MCB (MluI cell-cycle box) containing oligonucleotide. Both Mbp1 and Swi4 are specific for their cognate sites with respect to nonspecific DNA but exhibit similar affinities for the SCB (Swi4/Swi6 cell-cycle box) and MCB consensus elements.

These are localized to a central 5'-d(C-A/G-CG)-3' region common to both MCB and SCB sequences consistent with the observed pattern of specificity. Changes in the backbone amide proton and nitrogen chemical shifts upon DNA binding have enabled us to experimentally define a DNA-binding surface on the core N-terminal domain of Mbp1 that is associated with a putative winged helix-turn-helix motif.

Its catalytic domain is highly homologous to Ras-GEFs from all eukaryotes. Even though Cdc25 is the first Ras-GEF identified in any organism, we still know very little about how its function is regulated in yeast. In this work we provide evidence for the involvement of the N terminus of Cdc25 in the regulation of its activity. A truncated CDC25 lacking the noncatalytic C-terminal coding sequence was identified in a screen of high-copy suppressors of the heat-shock-sensitive phenotype of strains in which the Ras pathway is hyper-activated. The truncated gene acts as a dominant-negative mutant because it only suppresses the heat-shock sensitivity of strains that require the function of CDC25. Our two-hybrid assays and immunoprecipitation analyses show interactions between the N terminus of Cdc25 and itself, the C terminus, and the full-length protein. These results suggest that the dominant-negative effect may be a result of oligomerization with endogenous Cdc25. Further evidence of the role of the N terminus of Cdc25 in the regulation of its activity is provided by the mapping of the activating mutation of CDC25HS20 to the serine residue at position 365 in the noncatalytic N-terminal domain. This mutation induces a phenotype similar to activating mutants of other genes in the Ras pathway in yeast. Hence, the N terminus may exert a negative control on the catalytic activity of the protein.

To identify further rice HD-Zip proteins, one-hybrid screens were performed in yeast strains containing a HIS3 reporter gene with upstream HD-Zip recognition sites. This resulted in the isolation of six new cDNAs encoding HD-Zip proteins belonging to family I (Oshox4, -5, -6) or family II (Oshox2, -3, -7). In transient assays, using rice suspension-cultured cells transformed by particle bombardment, we showed previously that Oshox1 can transcriptionally repress the activity of reporter gene constructs with upstream HD-Zip binding sites. Here, we confirm the repression properties of Oshox1 by showing that the repression function can be conferred on a heterologous DNA-binding domain. This portable functional domain (residues 1-155) is located proximal to the HD-Zip domain. In yeast, the same region of the Oshox1 protein was found to confer transcriptional activation instead of repression, pointing to the possibility that cell type-specific factors may determine the functional properties of the Oshox1 protein in rice. Like Oshox1, another HD-Zip family II protein (Oshox3) was also found to function as a transcriptional repressor in rice cells. In contrast, two HD-Zip I family proteins (Oshox4 and -5) appeared to act as activators in both rice and yeast cells. Results of two-hybrid assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays strongly suggest that all HD-Zip proteins of families I and II can form homodimers and also heterodimers with all HD-Zip proteins of the same family. Heterodimerization across the HD-Zip families I and II apparently does not to occur.",PMID: 10732669 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,521: Gene  2000 Jan 25;242(1-2):369-79 
"INSERM U163, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.","The hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes severe liver disease, including liver cancer. A vaccine preventing HCV infection has not yet been developed, and, given the increasing number of infected people, this virus is now considered a major public-health problem. The HCV genome is a plus-stranded RNA that encodes a single polyprotein processed into at least 10 mature polypeptides. So far, only the interaction between the protease NS3 and its cofactor, NS4A, which is involved in the processing of the non-structural region, has been extensively studied. Our work was aimed at constructing a protein interaction map of HCV. A classical two-hybrid system failed to detect any interactions between mature HCV polypeptides, suggesting incorrect folding, expression or targetting of these proteins. We therefore developed a two-hybrid strategy, based on exhaustive screens of a random genomic HCV library. Using this method, we found known interactions, such as the capsid homodimer and the protease dimer, NS3-NS4A, as well as several novel interactions such as NS4A-NS2. Thus, our results are consistent with the idea that the use of a random genomic HCV library allows the selection of correctly folded viral protein fragments. Interacting domains of the viral polyprotein are identified, opening the possibility of developing specific anti-viral agents, based on their ability to modulate these interactions.",PMID: 10721731 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,522: Biochimie  2000 Jan;82(1):71-8

However, the identification of homologs of all three subunits in Saccharomyces cerevisiae offers the opportunity of examining the in vivo role of RPA. In our laboratory, we have previously isolated a missense allele of the RFA1 gene, encoding the p70 subunit of the RPA complex. Strains containing this mutant allele, rfa1-D228Y, display increased levels of direct-repeat recombination, decreased levels of heteroallelic recombination, UV sensitivity and a S-phase delay. In this study, we have characterized further the role of RPA by screening other replication and repair mutants for a synthetic lethal phenotype in combination with the rfa1-D228Y allele. Among the replication mutants examined, only one displayed a synthetic lethal phenotype, pol12-100, a conditional allele of the B subunit of pol alpha-primase. In addition, a delayed senescence phenotype was observed in raf1-D228Y strains containing a null mutation of HDF1, the S. cerevisiae homolog of the 70 kDa subunit of Ku. Interestingly, a synergistic reduction in telomere length observed in the double mutants suggests that the shortening of telomeres may be the cause of the decreased viability in these strains.

The DNA target site is recognized by an RNP complex containing the intron-encoded protein and the excised intron RNA. Here, we analyzed DNA target-site requirements for the Lactococcus lactis Ll.LtrB group II intron in vitro and in vivo. Our results suggest a model similar to yeast mtDNA introns, in which the intron-encoded protein first recognizes a small number of nucleotide residues in double-stranded DNA and causes DNA unwinding, enabling the intron RNA to base-pair with the DNA for reverse splicing. Antisense-strand cleavage requires additional interactions between the protein and 3' exon. Key nucleotide residues are recognized directly by the intron-encoded protein independent of sequence context, and there is a stringent requirement for fixed spacing between target site elements recognized by the protein and RNA components of the endonuclease. Experiments with DNA substrates containing GC-clamps or ""bubbles"" indicate a requirement for DNA unwinding in the 3' exon but not the distal 5' exon region. Finally, by applying the target-site recognition rules, we show that the L1.LtrB intron can be modified to insert at new sites in a plasmid-borne thyA gene in Escherichia coli. This strategy should be generally applicable to retargeting group II introns and to delivering foreign sequences to specific sites in heterologous genomes.",PMID: 10716944 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,

Due to the crucial role of WI-1 in adherence and disease pathogenesis, we investigated how the protein localizes to the surface of B. dermatitidis. WI-1 released extracellularly by wild-type yeast coated the surfaces of co-cultured knockout yeast within 3 h of incubation, implying that secreted WI-1 provides a pathway for loading the protein onto the yeast cell wall. In radioligand binding assays, purified WI-1 bound saturably, specifically, and with high affinity (K(d) = 8.3 x 10(-9)) to the cell surface of knockout yeast devoid of WI-1. WI-1 added exogenously, in vitro, to knockout yeast was indistinguishable from native cell surface WI-1 by fluorescence staining and restored adhesivity to the knockout yeast in macrophage binding and phagocytosis assays. Analysis of interactions between WI-1 and elements of the yeast cell wall identified chitin as the anchor point for WI-1. This interaction was shown to hinge on the 24-amino acid tandem repeat sequence of WI-1. Efforts to extract surface WI-1 from the yeast demonstrated that it is fastened to the wall by non-covalent interactions and covalent links between cysteine residues. We conclude that the yeast cell surface adhesin WI-1 localizes to the cell wall, in part, through extracellular release followed by high affinity binding back onto exposed chitin fibrils. These findings point to a novel pathway of cell wall biogenesis in yeast and an unanticipated role for chitin in anchoring and displaying a surface adhesin and virulence determinant.",PMID: 10713109 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,

Previously we have shown that the tyrosine kinase Lyn associates with the erythropoietin receptor and is essential for hemoglobin synthesis in three erythroleukemic cell lines. To understand Lyn signaling events in erythroid cells, the yeast two-hybrid system was used to analyze interactions with other proteins. Here we show that the hemopoietic-specific protein HS1 interacted directly with the SH3 domain of Lyn, via its proline-rich region. A truncated HS1, bearing the Lyn-binding domain, was introduced into J2E erythroleukemic cells to determine the impact upon responsiveness to erythropoietin. Truncated HS1 had a striking effect on the phenotype of the J2E line-the cells were smaller, more basophilic than the parental proerythoblastoid cells and had fewer surface erythropoietin receptors. Moreover, basal and erythropoietin-induced proliferation and differentiation were markedly suppressed. The inability of cells containing the truncated HS1 to differentiate may be a consequence of markedly reduced levels of Lyn and GATA-1. In addition, erythropoietin stimulation of these cells resulted in rapid, endosome-mediated degradation of endogenous HS1. The truncated HS1 also suppressed the development of erythroid colonies from fetal liver cells. These data show that disrupting HS1 has profoundly influenced the ability of erythroid cells to terminally differentiate.",PMID: 10713104 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,

Here we characterize Saccharomyces cerevisiae SEC24, which encodes a protein of 926 amino acids (YIL109C), and a close homologue, ISS1 (YNL049C), which is 55% identical to SEC24. SEC24 is essential for vesicular transport in vivo because depletion of Sec24p is lethal, causing exaggeration of the endoplasmic reticulum and a block in the maturation of carboxypeptidase Y. Overproduction of Sec24p suppressed the temperature sensitivity of sec23-2, and overproduction of both Sec24p and Sec23p suppressed the temperature sensitivity of sec16-2. SEC24 gene disruption could be complemented by overexpression of ISS1, indicating functional redundancy between the two homologous proteins. Deletion of ISS1 had no significant effect on growth or secretion; however, iss1Delta mutants were found to be synthetically lethal with mutations in the v-SNARE genes SEC22 and BET1. Moreover, overexpression of ISS1 could suppress mutations in SEC22. These genetic interactions suggest that Iss1p may be specialized for the packaging or the function of COPII v-SNAREs.

Wagner A.,"Department of Biology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, USA. wagnera@unm.edu","MOTIVATION: The question addressed here is how cooperative interactions among transcription factors (TFs), a very frequent phenomenon in eukaryotic transcriptional regulation, can be used to identify genes that are regulated by one or more TFs with known DNA binding specificities. Cooperativity may be homotypic, involving binding of only one transcription factor to multiple sites in a gene's regulatory region. It may also be heterotypic, involving binding of more than one TF. Both types of cooperativity have in common that the binding sites for the respective TFs form tightly linked 'clusters', groups of binding sites often more closely associated than expected by chance alone. RESULTS: A statistical technique suitable for the identification of statistically significant homotypic or heterotypic TF binding site clusters in whole eukaryotic genomes is presented. It can be used to identify genes likely to be regulated by the TFs. Application of the technique is illustrated with two transcription factors involved in the cell cycle and mating control of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that the results obtained are biologically meaningful.

Genetic and biochemical evidence indicated these nine proteins exist in three subcomplexes. Three of the OT subunits (Ost4p, Ost3p, and Stt3p) have been proposed to exist in one subcomplex. To investigate the interaction of these three membrane proteins, initially we carried out a mutational analysis of Ost4p, which is an extraordinarily small membrane protein containing only 36 amino acid residues. This analysis indicated that when single amino acid residues in a region close to the luminal face of the putative transmembrane domain of Ost4p were changed into an ionizable amino acid such as Lys or Asp, growth at 37 degrees C and OT activity measured in vitro were impaired. In addition, using immunoprecipitation techniques and Western blot analysis, we found that with these mutations the interaction between Ost4p, Ost3p, and Stt3p was disrupted. Introduction of Lys or Asp residues at other positions in the putative transmembrane domain or at the N or C terminus of Ost4p had no effect on disrupting subunit interactions or impairing the activity of OT.

Moreover, it is proposed that demetallated Ace1 is proteolytically degraded in the cell, resulting in a prolonged inhibition of copper-dependent CUP1 induction. These findings indicate that NO may serve as a disrupter of yeast copper metabolism.

Deletion of the REC8 gene increases S-phase length, by approximately 10% in wild-type and approximately 30% in a spo11Delta background. Thus, the progression of DNA replication is modulated by interchromosomal interaction proteins. The spo11-Y135F DSB (double strand break) catalysis-defective mutant is normal for S-phase modulation and DSB-independent homolog pairing but is defective for later events, formation of DSBs, and synaptonemal complexes. Thus, earlier and later functions of Spo11 are defined. We propose that meiotic S-phase progression is linked directly to development of specific chromosomal features required for meiotic interhomolog interactions and that this feedback process is built upon a more fundamental mechanism, common to all cell types, by which S-phase progression is coupled to development of nascent intersister connections and/or related aspects of chromosome morphogenesis.

In this study, we have purified the K241R and K241Q mutant proteins and compared their catalytic and DNA binding properties to that of the wild-type yOgg1.

The U1A autoregulatory complex requires two molecules of U1A protein to cooperatively bind a 50-nucleotide polyadenylation-inhibitory element (PIE) RNA located in the U1A 3' untranslated region. Based on both biochemical and nuclear magnetic resonance structural data, it was predicted that protein-protein interactions between the N-terminal regions (amino acids [aa] 1 to 115) of the two U1A proteins would form the basis for cooperative binding to PIE RNA and for inhibition of polyadenylation. In this study, we not only experimentally confirmed these predictions but discovered some unexpected features of how the U1A autoregulatory complex functions. We found that the U1A protein homodimerizes in the yeast two-hybrid system even when its ability to bind RNA is incapacitated. U1A dimerization requires two separate regions, both located in the N-terminal 115 residues. Using both coselection and gel mobility shift assays, U1A dimerization was also observed in vitro and found to depend on the same two regions that were found in vivo. Mutation of the second homodimerization region (aa 103 to 115) also resulted in loss of inhibition of polyadenylation and loss of cooperative binding of two U1A protein molecules to PIE RNA. This same mutation had no effect on the binding of one U1A protein molecule to PIE RNA. A peptide containing two copies of aa 103 to 115 is a potent inhibitor of polyadenylation.

Osmolyte-induced changes in protein conformational equilibria.,"Saunders AJ, Davis-Searles PR, Allen DL, Pielak GJ, Erie DA.","Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.","Examining solute-induced changes in protein conformational equilibria is a long-standing method for probing the role of water in maintaining protein stability. Interpreting the molecular details governing the solute-induced effects, however, remains controversial. We present experimental and theoretical data for osmolyte-induced changes in the stabilities of the A and N states of yeast iso-1-ferricytochrome c. Using polyol osmolytes of increasing size, we observe that osmolytes alone induce A-state formation from acid-denatured cytochrome c and N state formation from the thermally denatured protein. The stabilities of the A and N states increase linearly with osmolyte concentration. Interestingly, osmolytes stabilize the A state to a greater degree than the N state. To interpret the data, we divide the free energy for the reaction into contributions from nonspecific steric repulsions (excluded volume effects) and from binding interactions. We use scaled particle theory (SPT) to estimate the free energy contributions from steric repulsions, and we estimate the contributions from water-protein and osmolyte-protein binding interactions by comparing the SPT calculations to experimental data. We conclude that excluded volume effects are the primary stabilizing force, with changes in water-protein and solute-protein binding interactions making favorable contributions to stability of the A state and unfavorable contributions to the stability of the N state. The validity of our interpretation is strengthened by analysis of data on osmolyte-induced protein stabilization from the literature, and by comparison with other analyses of solute-induced changes in conformational equilibria.

Previously, dsRNA-binding proteins were shown to undergo homo- and heterodimerization, raising the possibility that regulation of activity could be controlled by interactions between different family members. Homodimerization is required to activate the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase PKR, whereas hetero-dimerization between PKR and other dsRNA-binding proteins can inhibit kinase activity. We have found that p74 also interacts with PKR, both the wild-type enzyme and a catalytically defective mutant (K296R). While co-expression of p74 and wild-type PKR in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae did not alter PKR activity, co-expression of p74 and the catalytically defective K296R mutant surprisingly resulted in abnormal morphology and cell death in transformants that maintained a high level of p74 expression. These transformants could be rescued by overexpression of the alpha-subunit of wild-type eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha), one of the known substrates for PKR. We hypothesize that competing heterodimers between p74-K296R PKR and eIF2alpha-K296R PKR may control cell growth such that stabilization of the p74-K296R PKR heterodimer induces abnormal morphology and cell death.",PMID: 10684936 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

Comparison of the kinetic constants for the excision of HX residues by the four enzymes shows that the E.coli and yeast enzymes are quite inefficient, whereas for the ANPG and the APDG proteins they repair the HX residues with an efficiency comparable to that of alkylated bases, which are believed to be the primary substrates of these DNA glycosylases. Since the use of various substrates to monitor the activity of HX-DNA glycosylases has generated conflicting results, the efficacy of the four 3-meAde-DNA glycosylases of different origin was compared using three different substrates. Moreover, using oligo-nucleotides containing a single dIMP residue, we investigated a putative sequence specificity of the enzymes involving the bases next to the HX residue. We found up to 2-5-fold difference in the rates of HX excision between the various sequences of the oligonucleotides studied. When the dIMP residue was placed opposite to each of the four bases, a preferential recognition of dI:T over dI:dG, dI:dC and dI:dA mismatches was observed for both human (ANPG) and E.coli (AlkA) proteins. At variance, the yeast MAG protein removed more efficiently HX from a dI:dG over dI:dC, dI:T and dI:dA mismatches.",PMID: 10684927 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
The assembly factor Atp11p binds to the beta-subunit of the mitochondrial F(1)-ATPase.,"Wang ZG, Ackerman SH.","Department of Surgery, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA.","Atp11p is a protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae required for the assembly of the F(1) component of the mitochondrial F(1)F(0)-ATP synthase. This study presents evidence that Atp11p binds selectively to the beta-subunit of F(1). Under conditions in which avidin-Sepharose beads specifically adsorbed biotinylated Atp11p from yeast mitochondrial extracts, the F(1) beta-subunit coprecipitated with the tagged Atp11p protein. Binding interactions between Atp11p and the entire beta-subunit of F(1) or fragments of the beta-subunit were also revealed by a yeast two-hybrid screen: Atp11p bound to a region of the nucleotide-binding domain of the beta-subunit located between Gly(114) and Leu(318). Certain elements of this sequence that would be accessible to Atp11p in the free beta-subunit make contact with adjacent alpha-subunits in the assembled enzyme. This observation suggests that the alpha-subunits may exchange for bound Atp11p during the process of F(1) assembly.",PMID: 10681564 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Anatomy of a proficient enzyme: the structure of orotidine 5'-monophosphate decarboxylase in the presence and absence of a potential transition state analog.,"Miller BG, Hassell AM, Wolfenden R, Milburn MV, Short SA.","Department of Biochemistry, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA. Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA.","Orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase produces the largest rate enhancement that has been reported for any enzyme. The crystal structure of the recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae enzyme has been determined in the absence and presence of the proposed transition state analog 6-hydroxyuridine 5'-phosphate, at a resolution of 2.1 A and 2.4 A, respectively. Orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase folds as a TIM-barrel with the ligand binding site near the open end of the barrel. The binding of 6-hydroxyuridine 5'-phosphate is accompanied by protein loop movements that envelop the ligand almost completely, forming numerous favorable interactions with the phosphoryl group, the ribofuranosyl group, and the pyrimidine ring. Lysine-93 appears to be anchored in such a way as to optimize electrostatic interactions with developing negative charge at C-6 of the pyrimidine ring, and to donate the proton that replaces the carboxylate group at C-6 of the product. In addition, H-bonds from the active site to O-2 and O-4 help to delocalize negative charge in the transition state. Interactions between the enzyme and the phosphoribosyl group anchor the pyrimidine within the active site, helping to explain the phosphoribosyl group's remarkably large contribution to catalysis despite its distance from the site of decarboxylation.",PMID: 10681417 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

The core enhancer assembly requires the interactions of the POU-homeodomain protein Oct-1, the viral transactivator alphaTIF and the cellular factor C1 (HCF). In this context, the C1 factor interacts with each protein to assemble the stable enhancer complex. In addition, the IE enhancer cores contain adjacent binding sites for other cellular transcription factors such as Sp1 and GA-binding protein (GABP). In this study, a direct interaction of the C1 factor with GABP is demonstrated, defining the C1 factor as the critical coordinator of the enhancer complex assembly. In addition, mutations that reduce the GABP transactivation potential also impair the C1-GABP interaction, indicating that the C1 factor functions as a novel coactivator of GABP-mediated transcription. The interaction and coordinated assembly of the enhancer proteins by the C1 factor may be critical for the regulation of the HSV lytic-latent cycle.",PMID: 10675337 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

Here, we report the construction of a highly representative two-hybrid genomic library for the dimorphic yeast Yarrowia lipolytica based on the system described by James et al. (1996. Genetics 144, 1425-1436). The endoplasmic reticulum protein Slslp was then used as a bait in a functional test of the library. Indeed, we previously showed that the SLS1 gene product is involved in protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and interacts physically in a two-hybrid assay with Kar2p, an essential luminal member of the HSP70 family (Boisrame et al., 1998.

No other partner than Kar2p was identified in this screen. As an interesting result, Kar2p interacts with Slslp through its ATPase domain, supporting our hypothesis that Slslp is a cofactor of the chaperone protein, modulating its activity during the HSP70 cycle.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc14 phosphatase is implicated in the structural organization of the nucleolus.,"de Almeida A, Raccurt I, Peyrol S, Charbonneau M.","UMR CNRS/ENS no 5665, Ecole Normale Superieure, Lyon, France.","Cdc14, a dual-specificity protein phosphatase, has been previously implicated in triggering exit from mitosis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using immunofluorescence microscopy and immunogold labeling, we demonstrate that a functional HA-tagged version of the phosphatase Cdc14 localizes to the nucleolus. Moreover, Cdc14-HA co-localized with the nucleolar NOP2 and GAR1 proteins. By immunofluorescence, Cdc14-HA was found in the nucleolus during most of the mitotic cell cycle, except during anaphase-telophase when it redistributed along the mitotic spindle. While this work was in progress, the same pattern of Cdc14 localization was described by others (Visintin et al, Nature 398 (1999) 818). Constitutive overexpression of CDC14 was toxic and led to cell cycle arrest of cells, mainly in G1. This correlated with the appearance of abnormal nuclear structures. A genetic search for suppressors of the lethality associated with CDC14 overexpression identified YJL076W. Because overproduction of Yj1076w buffered the toxic effect of Cdc14 overproduction, this suggested that it might be a substrate of Cdc14. This has indeed been found to be the case by others who recently described Yj1076w/Netl as a nucleolar protein that physically associates with Cdc14 (Shou et al, Cell 97 (1999) 233). The present data confirm several recently uncovered aspects of the regulation of Cdc14 localization and activity and suggest that the level of expression of CDC14 influences the structural organization of the nucleolus.",PMID: 10668096 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

They bind to a specific Rep recognition sequence (RRS) found in both the viral inverted terminal repeats and the AAVS1 integration locus on human chromosome 19. Previous in vitro studies implied that an N-terminal segment of Rep is involved in DNA recognition, while additional domains might stabilize binding and mediate multimerization. In order to define the minimal requirements for Rep to recognize its target site in the human genome, we developed one-hybrid assays in which DNA-protein interactions are detected in vivo. Chimeric proteins consisting of the N terminus of Rep fused to different oligomerization motifs and a transcriptional activation domain were analyzed for oligomerization, DNA binding, and activation of reporter gene expression. Expression of reporter genes was driven from RRS motifs cloned upstream of minimal promoters and examined in mammalian cells from transfected plasmids and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae from a reporter cassette integrated into the yeast genome. Our results show for the first time that chimeric proteins containing the amino-terminal 244 residues of Rep are able to target the RRS in vitro and in vivo when incorporated into artificial multimers. These studies suggest that chimeric proteins may be used to harness the unique targeting feature of AAV for gene therapy applications.",PMID: 10666268 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Two paralogs involved in transcriptional silencing that antagonistically control yeast life span.,"Roy N, Runge KW.","Department of Molecular Biology, The Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.","In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, one determinant of aging or life span is the accumulation of extrachromosomal copies of rDNA circles in old mother cells [1]. The production of rDNA circles depends upon intrachromosomal recombination within the rDNA tandem array, a process regulated by the protein Sir2 (Sir2p). Together with Sir1p, Sir3p, Sir4p and Orc1p, Sir2p is also involved in transcriptional silencing of genes at the silent mating-type cassettes, in the rDNA array, and at telomeres. Using a 'triple silencer' strain that can monitor an increase or decrease in gene expression at these three loci, we found that deletion of the ZDS1 gene caused an increase in silencing in the rDNA and at a silent mating-type cassette at the expense of telomere silencing. The zds1 deletion also resulted in an increase in life span and a decrease in Sir3p phosphorylation. In contrast, deletion of its paralog ZDS2 caused a decrease in rDNA silencing, a decrease in life span and an increase in Sir3p phosphorylation. As Zds2p, but not Zds1p, had strong two-hybrid interactions with Orc1p and the four Sir proteins, Zds1p might indirectly control Sir3p through a Sir3p kinase.",PMID: 10662670 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Multiple interactions among proteins encoded by the mite-transmitted wheat streak mosaic tritimovirus.,"Choi IR, Stenger DC, French R.","School of Biological Sciences, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska 68583, USA.","The genome organization of the mite-transmitted wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) appears to parallel that of members of the Potyviridae with monopartite genomes, but there are substantial amino acid dissimilarities with other potyviral polyproteins. To initiate studies on the functions of WSMV-encoded proteins, a protein interaction map was generated using a yeast two-hybrid system. Because the pathway of proteolytic maturation of the WSMV polyprotein has not been experimentally determined, random libraries of WSMV cDNA were made both in DNA-binding domain and activation domain plasmid vectors and introduced into yeast. Sequence analysis of multiple interacting pairs revealed that interactions largely occurred between domains within two groups of proteins. The first involved interactions among nuclear inclusion protein a, nuclear inclusion protein b, and coat protein (CP), and the second involved helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro) and cylindrical inclusion protein (CI). Further immunoblot and deletion mapping analyses of the interactions suggest that subdomains of CI, HC-Pro, and P1 interact with one another. The two-hybrid assay was then performed using full-length genes of CI, HC-Pro, P1, P3, and CP, but no heterologous interactions were detected. In vitro binding assay using glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins and in vitro translation products, however, revealed mutual interactions among CI, HC-Pro, P1, and P3. The failure to detect interactions between full-length proteins by the two-hybrid assay might be due to adverse effects of expression of viral proteins in yeast cells. The capacity to participate in multiple homomeric and heteromeric molecular interactions is consistent with the pleiotropic nature of many potyviral gene mutants and suggests mechanisms for regulation of various viral processes via a network of viral protein complexes.

Coordinated spindle assembly and orientation requires Clb5p-dependent kinase in budding yeast.,"Segal M, Clarke DJ, Maddox P, Salmon ED, Bloom K, Reed SI.","Department of Molecular Biology, MB7, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.","The orientation of the mitotic spindle along a polarity axis is critical in asymmetric cell divisions. In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, loss of the S-phase B-type cyclin Clb5p under conditions of limited cyclin-dependent kinase activity (cdc28-4 clb5Delta cells) causes a spindle positioning defect that results in an undivided nucleus entering the bud. Based on time-lapse digital imaging microscopy of microtubules labeled with green fluorescent protein fusions to either tubulin or dynein, we observed that the asymmetric behavior of the spindle pole bodies during spindle assembly was lost in the cdc28-4 clb5Delta cells. As soon as a spindle formed, both poles were equally likely to interact with the bud cell cortex. Persistent dynamic interactions with the bud ultimately led to spindle translocation across the bud neck. Thus, the mutant failed to assign one spindle pole body the task of organizing astral microtubules towards the mother cell. Our data suggest that Clb5p-associated kinase is required to confer mother-bound behavior to one pole in order to establish correct spindle polarity. In contrast, B-type cyclins, Clb3p and Clb4p, though partially redundant with Clb5p for an early role in spindle morphogenesis, preferentially promote spindle assembly.",PMID: 10662771 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
SLG1 plays a role during G1 in the decision to enter or exit the cell cycle.,"Ivanovska I, Rose MD.","Department of Molecular Biology, Princeton University, NJ 08544-1014, USA.","Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells decide to divide during G1. If nutrients are abundant, cells pass through START and coordinately undergo DNA replication, bud emergence, and spindle pole body duplication. Phenotypic analysis of the slg1delta mutant revealed that this mutation uncouples post-START events. At the nonpermissive temperature, slg1delta cells that have undergone bud emergence but not DNA replication or SPB duplication accumulate. Furthermore, while wild-type cells arrest in GO when starved, the slg1delta mutant fails to arrest at this point; instead, cells with small buds accumulate. The slg1delta mutation displayed genetic interactions with cdc34, which encodes a regulator of exit from G1. This is consistent with a role of SLG1 in G1 regulation. Epitope-tagged Slg1p cofractionated with the plasma membrane, suggesting that Slglp may function by integrating external cues and relaying them to the interior of the cell. We propose that SLG1 plays a regulatory role in bud emergence or stationary phase.",PMID: 10660075 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Domain III of Saccharomyces cerevisiae 25 S ribosomal RNA: its role in binding of ribosomal protein L25 and 60 S subunit formation.,"van Beekvelt CA, Kooi EA, de Graaff-Vincent M, Riet J, Venema J, Raue HA.","Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, IMBW BioCentrum Amsterdam, Vrije Universiteit, de Boelelaan 1083, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.","Domain III of Saccharomyces cerevisiae 25 S rRNA contains the recognition site for the primary rRNA-binding ribosomal protein L25, which belongs to the functionally conserved EL23/L25 family of ribosomal proteins. The EL23/L25 binding region is very complex, consisting of several irregular helices held together by long-distance secondary and tertiary interactions. Moreover, it contains the eukaryote-specific V9 (D7a) expansion segment. Functional characterisation of the structural elements of this site by a detailed in vitro and in vivo mutational analysis indicates the presence of two separate regions that are directly involved in L25 binding. In particular, mutation of either of two conserved nucleotides in the loop of helix 49 significantly reduces in vitro L25 binding, thus strongly supporting their role as attachment sites for the r-protein. Two other helices appear to be primarily required for the correct folding of the binding site. Mutations that abolish in vitro binding of L25 block accumulation of 25 S rRNA in vivo because they stall pre-rRNA processing at the level of its immediate precursor, the 27 S(B) pre-rRNA. Surprisingly, several mutations that do not significantly affect L25 binding in vitro cause the same lethal defect in 27 S(B) pre-rRNA processing. Deletion of the V9 expansion segment also leads to under-accumulation of mature 25 S rRNA and a twofold reduction in growth rate. We conclude that an intact domain III, including the V9 expansion segment, is essential for normal processing and assembly of 25 S rRNA.

Hal2p belongs to a larger superfamily of lithium-sensitive phosphatases which includes inositol monophosphatase.

The present work demonstrates genetic and physical interactions among Nrd1p, the pol II CTD, Nab3p, and the CTD kinase CTDK-I. Previous studies have shown that Nrd1p associates with the CTD of pol II in yeast two-hybrid assays via its CTD-interaction domain (CID).

Nab3p, a yeast hnRNP, is a high-copy suppressor of some nrd1 temperature-sensitive alleles, interacts with Nrd1p in a yeast two-hybrid assay, and coimmunoprecipitates with Nrd1p. Temperature-sensitive alleles of NAB3 are suppressed by deletion of CTK1, a kinase that has been shown to phosphorylate the CTD and increase elongation efficiency in vitro.

No activation of the reporter gene was observed in yeast co-expressing FANCA and FANCC as hybrid proteins, suggesting that FANCA does not directly interact with FANCC. However, a high level of activation was found when FANCA was co-expressed with FANCG, indicating strong, direct interaction between these proteins. Both FANCA and FANCG show weak but consistent interaction with themselves, suggesting that their function may involve dimerisation. The site of interaction of FANCG with FANCA was investigated by analysis of 12 mutant fragments of FANCG.

The structural basis of substrate activation in yeast pyruvate decarboxylase. A crystallographic and kinetic study.,"Lu G, Dobritzsch D, Baumann S, Schneider G, Konig S.","Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.","The crystal structure of the complex of the thiamine diphosphate dependent tetrameric enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) from brewer's yeast strain with the activator pyruvamide has been determined to 2.4 A resolution. The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains two subunits, and the tetrameric molecule is generated by crystallographic symmetry. Structure analysis revealed conformational nonequivalence of the active sites. One of the two active sites in the asymmetric unit was found in an open conformation, with two active site loop regions (residues 104-113 and 290-304) disordered. In the other subunit, these loop regions are well-ordered and shield the active site from the bulk solution. In the closed enzyme subunit, one molecule of pyruvamide is bound in the active site channel, and is located in the vicinity of the thiazolium ring of the cofactor. A second pyruvamide binding site was found at the interface between the Pyr and the R domains of the subunit in the closed conformation, about 10 A away from residue C221. This second pyruvamide molecule might function in stabilizing the unique orientation of the R domain in this subunit which in turn is important for dimer-dimer interactions in the activated tetramer. No difference electron density in the close vicinity of the side chain of residue C221 was found, indicating that this residue does not form a covalent adduct with an activator molecule. Kinetic experiments showed that substrate activation was not affected by oxidation of cysteine residues and therefore does not seem to be dependent on intact thiol groups in the enzyme. The results suggest that a disorder-order transition of two active-site loop regions is a key event in the activation process triggered by the activator pyruvamide and that covalent modification of C221 is not required for this transition to occur. Based on these findings, a possible mechanism for the activation of PDC by its substrate, pyruvate, is proposed.",PMID: 10651824 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Yeast meiosis-specific protein Hop1 binds to G4 DNA and promotes its formation.,"Muniyappa K, Anuradha S, Byers B.","Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012, India.","DNA molecules containing stretches of contiguous guanine residues can assume a stable configuration in which planar quartets of guanine residues joined by Hoogsteen pairing appear in a stacked array.

Moreover, the ability of the yeast SEP1 gene product to cleave DNA in a G4-DNA-dependent fashion, as well as that of the SGS1 gene product to unwind G4 DNA, has suggested a crucial role for this structure in meiotic synapsis and recombination. Here, we demonstrate that the HOP1 gene product, which plays a crucial role in the formation of synaptonemal complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, binds robustly to G4 DNA. The apparent dissociation constant for interaction with G4 DNA is 2 x 10(-10), indicative of binding that is about 1,000-fold stronger than to normal duplex DNA. Oligonucleotides of appropriate sequence bound Hop1 protein maximally if the DNA was first subjected to conditions favoring the formation of G4 DNA. Furthermore, incubation of unfolded oligonucleotides with Hop1 led to their transformation into G4 DNA. Methylation interference experiments confirmed that modifications blocking G4 DNA formation inhibit Hop1 binding. In contrast, neither bacterial RecA proteins that preferentially interact with GT-rich DNA nor histone H1 bound strongly to G4 DNA or induced its formation. These findings implicate specific interactions of Hop1 protein with G4 DNA in the pathway to chromosomal synapsis and recombination in meiosis.",PMID: 10648621 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Regulatory interactions between the Reg1-Glc7 protein phosphatase and the Snf1 protein kinase.,"Sanz P, Alms GR, Haystead TA, Carlson M.","Departments of Genetics and Development and Microbiology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA.","Protein phosphatase 1, comprising the regulatory subunit Reg1 and the catalytic subunit Glc7, has a role in glucose repression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Previous studies showed that Reg1 regulates the Snf1 protein kinase in response to glucose. Here, we explore the functional relationships between Reg1, Glc7, and Snf1. We show that different sequences of Reg1 interact with Glc7 and Snf1. We use a mutant Reg1 altered in the Glc7-binding motif to demonstrate that Reg1 facilitates the return of the activated Snf1 kinase complex to the autoinhibited state by targeting Glc7 to the complex. Genetic evidence indicated that the catalytic activity of Snf1 negatively regulates its interaction with Reg1. We show that Reg1 is phosphorylated in response to glucose limitation and that this phosphorylation requires Snf1; moreover, Reg1 is dephosphorylated by Glc7 when glucose is added. Finally, we show that hexokinase PII (Hxk2) has a role in regulating the phosphorylation state of Reg1, which may account for the effect of Hxk2 on Snf1 function. These findings suggest that the phosphorylation of Reg1 by Snf1 is required for the release of Reg1-Glc7 from the kinase complex and also stimulates the activity of Glc7 in promoting closure of the complex.",PMID: 10648618 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

The COOH-terminal tail of yeast myosin-I proteins, Myo3p and Myo5p, contains an Src homology domain 3 (SH3) followed by an acidic domain. The myosin-I SH3 domain interacted with both Bee1p and Vrp1p, yeast homologues of human WASP and WIP, adapter proteins that link actin assembly and signaling molecules. The myosin-I acidic domain interacted with Arp2/3 complex subunits, Arc40p and Arc19p, and showed both sequence similarity and genetic redundancy with the COOH-terminal acidic domain of Bee1p (Las17p), which controls Arp2/3-mediated actin nucleation. These findings suggest that myosin-I proteins may participate in a diverse set of motility functions through a role in actin assembly."

RecQ helicases have been shown to unwind DNA in an ATP-dependent manner. However, the specific functional roles of these proteins in DNA recombination and replication are not known. An HRDC domain exists in both of the human RecQ homologues that are implicated in human disease and may have an important role in their function. RESULTS: We have determined the three-dimensional structure of the HRDC domain in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RecQ helicase Sgs1p by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The structure resembles auxiliary domains in bacterial DNA helicases and other proteins that interact with nucleic acids. We show that a positively charged region on the surface of the Sgs1p HRDC domain can interact with DNA. Structural similarities to bacterial DNA helicases suggest that the HRDC domain functions as an auxiliary domain in RecQ helicases. Homology models of the Werner and Bloom HRDC domains show different surface properties when compared with Sgs1p. CONCLUSIONS: The HRDC domain represents a structural scaffold that resembles auxiliary domains in proteins that are involved in nucleic acid metabolism. In Sgs1p, the HRDC domain could modulate the helicase function via auxiliary contacts to DNA. However, in the Werner and Bloom syndrome helicases the HRDC domain may have a role in their functional differences by mediating diverse molecular interactions."

Separation of binding and coupling determinants in the galpha subunit.,"Swift S, Sheridan PJ, Covic L, Kuliopulos A.","Molecular Cardiology Research Institute, Division of Hematology, New England Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, USA.","Signal transfer between the protease-activated PAR1 thrombin receptor and membrane-associated heterotrimeric G proteins is mediated by protein-protein interactions. We constructed a yeast signaling system that resolves domain-specific functions of binding from coupling in the Galpha subunit. The endogenous yeast Galpha subunit, Gpa1, does not bind to PAR1 and served as a null structural template. N- and C-terminal portions of mammalian G(i2) and G(16) were substituted back into the Gpa1 template and gain-of-function assessed. The C-terminal third of G(16), but not of G(i2), provides sufficient interactions for coupling to occur with PAR1. The N-terminal two-thirds of G(i2) also contains sufficient determinants to bind and couple to PAR1 and overcome the otherwise negative or missing interactions supplied by the C-terminal third of Gpa1. Replacement of the N-terminal alpha-helix of G(i2), residues 1-34, with those of Gpa1 abolishes coupling but not binding to PAR1 or to betagamma subunits. These data support a model that the N-terminal alphaN helix of the Galpha subunit is physically interposed between PAR1 and the Gbeta subunit and directly assists in transferring the signal between agonist-activated receptor and G protein."

A heterologous interaction between VP1 and VP3, and homologous interactions of pVP2, VP3, VP5 and possibly VP1, were found by co-expression of the fusion proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The presence of the VP1-VP3 complex in IBDV-infected cells was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation studies. Kinetic analyses showed that the complex of VP1 and VP3 is formed in the cytoplasm and eventually is released into the cell-culture medium, indicating that VP1-VP3 complexes are present in mature virions. In IBDV-infected cells, VP1 was present in two forms of 90 and 95 kDa. Whereas VP3 initially interacted with both the 90 and 95 kDa proteins, later it interacted exclusively with the 95 kDa protein both in infected cells and in the culture supernatant. These results suggest that the VP1-VP3 complex is involved in replication and packaging of the IBDV genome."

We show that a prespliceosome-like complex forms in the absence of ATP in yeast extracts lacking the U2 suppressor protein CUS2. These complexes display the same pre-mRNA and U snRNA requirements as authentic prespliceosomes and can be chased through the splicing pathway, indicating that they are a functional intermediate in the spliceosome assembly pathway. ATP-independent prespliceosome-like complexes are also observed in extracts containing a mutant U2 snRNA. Loss of CUS2 does not bypass the role of PRP5, an RNA helicase family member required for ATP-dependent prespliceosome formation. Genetic interactions between CUS2 and a heat-sensitive prp5 allele parallel those observed between CUS2 and U2, and suggest that CUS2 mediates functional interactions between U2 RNA and PRP5. We propose that CUS2 enforces ATP dependence during formation of the prespliceosome by brokering an interaction between PRP5 and the U2 snRNP that depends on correct U2 RNA structure."

Analysis of their mRNA levels in different human tissues reveals a common ubiquitous expression pattern. A multitude of two-hybrid interactions among the human cDNAs suggest that their encoded proteins also form a complex in mammalian cells. Functional conservation of these proteins throughout evolution is supported by the observation that the isolated human NOT3 and NOT4 cDNAs can partially com-plement corresponding not mutations in yeast. Interestingly, human CALIF is highly homologous to, although clearly different from, a recently described human CAF1 protein. Conserved interactions of this factor with both NOT and CCR4 proteins and co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that CALIF is a bona fide component of the human CCR4-NOT complex."

These experimental clues suggest a mechanism for the principal molecular interactions controlling cyclin synthesis and degradation.

Cytological and genetic analyses of these cdc42 mutants revealed novel and diverse phenotypes, showing that Cdc42p possesses at least two distinct essential functions and acts as a nodal point of cell polarity regulation in vivo. In addition, mapping the functional data for each cdc42 mutation onto a structural model of the protein revealed as functionally important a surface of Cdc42p that is distinct from the canonical protein-interacting domains (switch I, switch II, and the C terminus) identified previously in members of the Ras superfamily.

A major component of the hemidesmosome plaque is the 230-kDa bullous pemphigoid autoantigen (BP230/BPAG1), which connects directly to the keratin-containing intermediate filaments of the cytoskeleton via its C terminus. A second bullous pemphigoid antigen of 180 kDa (BP180/BPAG2) is a type II transmembrane component of the hemidesmosome. Using yeast two-hybrid technology and recombinant proteins, we show that an N-terminal fragment of BP230 can bind directly to an N-terminal fragment of BP180. We have also explored the consequences of expression of the BP230 N terminus in 804G cells that assemble hemidesmosomes in vitro. Unexpectedly, this fragment disrupts the distribution of BP180 in transfected cells but has no apparent impact on the organization of endogenous BP230 and alpha6beta4 integrin.

Raft lipids are believed to exist in a state similar to the liquid-ordered phase. It has been proposed that proteins with a high affinity for an ordered lipid environment will preferentially partition into rafts (Melkonian, K. A., Ostermeyer, A. G., Chen, J. Z., Roth, M. G., and Brown, D. A. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 3910-3917). We investigated the possibility that lipid-lipid interactions between lipid-modified proteins and raft lipids mediate targeting of proteins to these domains. G protein monomers or trimers were reconstituted in liposomes, engineered to mimic raft domains. Assay for partitioning of G proteins into rafts was based on Triton X-100 insolubility. Myristoylation and palmitoylation of Galpha(i) were necessary and sufficient for association with liposomes and partitioning into rafts. Strikingly, the amount of fatty-acylated Galpha(i) in rafts was significantly reduced when myristoylated Galpha(i) was thioacylated with cis-unsaturated fatty acids instead of saturated fatty acids such as palmitate. Prenylated betagamma subunits were excluded from rafts, whether reconstituted alone or with fatty-acylated alpha subunits. These results suggest that the structural difference between lipids that modify proteins is one basis for the selectivity of protein targeting to rafts."

The capacity of RPP0 genes from Aspergillus fumigatus, Dictyostelium discoideum, Rattus norvegicus, Homo sapiens, and Leishmania infantum to complement the absence of the homologous gene has been tested. In S. cerevisiae W303dGP0, a strain containing standard amounts of the four P1/P2 protein types, all heterologous genes were functional except the one from L. infantum, some of them inducing an osmosensitive phenotype at 37 degrees C. The polymerizing activity and the elongation factor-dependent functions but not the peptide bond formation capacity is affected in the heterologous P0 containing ribosomes. The heterologous P0 proteins bind to the yeast ribosomes but the composition of the ribosomal stalk is altered. Only proteins P1alpha and P2beta are found in ribosomes carrying the A. fumigatus, R. norvegicus, and H. sapiens proteins. When the heterologous genes are expressed in a conditional null-P0 mutant whose ribosomes are totally deprived of P1/P2 proteins, none of the heterologous P0 proteins complemented the conditional phenotype. In contrast, chimeric P0 proteins made of different amino-terminal fragments from mammalian origin and the complementary carboxyl-terminal fragments from yeast allow W303dGP0 and D67dGP0 growth at restrictive conditions.

To characterize further the interactions between the different proteins, we used the two-hybrid system, which showed that ArgRI and Mcm1 interact together, and with ArgRII and ArgRIII, without an arginine requirement. To define the interacting domains of ArgRI and Mcm1 with ArgRIII, we fused portions of ArgRI and Mcm1 to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 (GBD) and created mutations in GBD-ArgRI and GBD-Mcm1. The putative alpha helix present in the MADS-box domain of ArgRI and Mcm1 is their major region of interaction with ArgRIII. Interactions between the two MADS-box proteins and ArgRIII were confirmed using affinity chromatography. The requirement for ArgRIII in the control of arginine metabolism can be bypassed in vitro as well as in vivo by overproducing ArgRI or Mcm1, which indicates that ArgRIII is not present in the protein complex formed with the 'arginine boxes'. We show that the impairment of arginine regulation in an argRIII deletant strain is a result of a lack of stability of ArgRI and Mcm1. A mutation in ArgRI, impairing its interaction with ArgRIII, leads to an unstable ArgRI protein in a wild-type strain. ArgRIII integrity is crucial for Mcm1 function, as shown by the marked decreased expression of five genes controlled by Mcm1. However, ArgRIII is likely to recruit other proteins in the yeast cell, as overexpression of Mcm1 does not compensate some physiological defects observed in an argRIII deletant strain."

To further understand the molecular mechanisms underlying clathrin-mediated protein transport pathways, we initiated a genetic screen for mutations that display synthetic growth defects when combined with a temperature-sensitive allele of the clathrin heavy chain gene (chc1-521) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mutations, when present in cells with wild-type clathrin, were analyzed for effects on mating pheromone alpha-factor precursor maturation and sorting of the vacuolar protein carboxypeptidase Y as measures of protein sorting at the yeast trans-Golgi network (TGN) compartment. By these criteria, two classes of mutants were obtained, those with and those without defects in protein sorting at the TGN. One mutant with unaltered protein sorting at the TGN contains a mutation in PTC1, a type 2c serine/threonine phosphatase with widespread influences. The collection of mutants displaying TGN sorting defects includes members with mutations in previously identified vacuolar protein sorting genes (VPS), including the dynamin family member VPS1. Striking genetic interactions were observed by combining temperature-sensitive alleles of CHC1 and VPS1, supporting the model that Vps1p is involved in clathrin-mediated vesicle formation at the TGN. Also in the spectrum of mutants with TGN sorting defects are isolates with mutations in the following: RIC1, encoding a product originally proposed to participate in ribosome biogenesis; LUV1, encoding a product potentially involved in vacuole and microtubule organization; and INP53, encoding a synaptojanin-like inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase. Disruption of INP53, but not the related INP51 and INP52 genes, resulted in alpha-factor maturation defects and exacerbated alpha-factor maturation defects when combined with chc1-521.

Although the PRP17/CDC40 gene product is essential only at elevated temperatures, splicing intermediates accumulate in prp17 mutants even at the permissive temperature. In this report we describe extensive genetic interactions between PRP17/CDC40 and the PRP8 gene. PRP8 encodes a highly conserved U5 snRNP protein required for spliceosome assembly and for both catalytic steps of the splicing reaction. We show that mutations in the PRP8 gene are able to suppress the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype and the splicing defect conferred by the absence of the Prp17 protein. In addition, these mutations are capable of suppressing certain alterations in the conserved PyAG trinucleotide at the 3' splice junction, as detected by an ACT1-CUP1 splicing reporter system. Moreover, other PRP8 alleles exhibit synthetic lethality with the absence of Prp17p and show a reduced ability to splice an intron bearing an altered 3' splice junction.

Similarly, monomers with dimer-interface substitutions and monomers harboring in vivo selected mutations that confer multidrug resistance (mdr) in an AIDS patient were tested for interaction in yeast. Dimer formation between wt monomers with catalytic aspartates was not detected in yeast, whereas the dimerization of PR monomers harboring the acid active site substitution D25N was readily demonstrated. The use of inactive monomers harboring the D25N substitution as a genetic background for studying additional HIV PR mutations allowed for the probing of interactions between monomers with mdr-associated mutations with those based on the HIV-1 HXB2R sequence. The HTLVIII/HIV-1 HXB2R clone has been the basis for a large number of HIV-related plasmids, primers, antibodies, and other specific reagents throughout the HIV research community.

The identity of a majority of the genes controlled by HSF and the circumstances under which HSF becomes induced are known, but the details of the mechanism by which HSF is able to sense and respond to heat remains an enigma. For example, it is unclear whether HSF senses the heat shock directly or requires ancillary interactions from a heat-induced signaling pathway. We present the analysis of a series of mutations in an alpha-helical bulge in the DNA-binding domain of HSF. Deletion of residues in this bulged region increases the overall activity of the protein. Yeast containing the deletion mutant HSF are able to survive growth temperatures that are lethal to yeast containing wild-type HSF, and they are also constitutively thermotolerant. The increase in activity can be measured as an increase in both constitutive and induced transcriptional activity. The mutant proteins bind DNA more tightly than the wild-type protein does, but this is unlikely to account fully for the increase in transcriptional activity as yeast HSF is constitutively bound to its binding site in vivo. The stability of the mutant proteins to thermal denaturation is lower than wild-type, though their native-state structures are still well-folded. Therefore, the mutants may be structurally analogous to the heat-induced state of HSF, and suggest that the DNA-binding domain of HSF may be capable of sensing heat shock directly.

If such optimization is performed for each operation separately with respect to objectives defined for each operation individually, overall process performance is likely to be suboptimal. Interactions between unit operations have to be considered, and a unique objective has to be defined for the whole process. This paper shows how a suitable optimization problem can be formulated and solved to obtain the best overall set of operating conditions for a process. A typical enzyme production process has been chosen as an example. In order to arrive at a demonstrative model for the entire sequence of unit operations, it is shown how interaction effects may be accommodated in the models. Optimal operating conditions are then determined subject to a global process objective and are shown to be different from those resulting from optimization of each separate operation. As this strategy may result in an economic benefit, it merits further research into interaction modeling and performance optimization. Copyright 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc."

These results show that Pfs2p plays an essential role in 3'-end formation by bridging different processing factors and thereby promoting the assembly of the processing complex."

Molecular modeling of complexes with glucoamylase.,"Randell KD, Frandsen TP, Stoffer B, Johnson MA, Svensson B, Pinto BM.","Department of Chemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada.","The synthesis of a series of 5-thio-D-glucopyranosylarylamines by reaction of 5-thio-D-glucopyranose pentaacetate with the corresponding arylamine and mercuric chloride catalyst is reported. The products were obtained as anomeric mixtures of the tetraacetates which can be separated and crystallized. The tetraacetates were deprotected to give alpha/beta mixtures of the parent compounds which were evaluated as inhibitors of the hydrolysis of maltose by glucoamylase G2 (GA). A transferred NOE NMR experiment with an alpha/beta mixture of 7 in the presence of GA showed that only the alpha isomer is bound by the enzyme. The Ki values, calculated on the basis of specific binding of the alpha isomers, are 0.47 mM for p-methoxy-N-phenyl-5-thio-D-glucopyranosylamine (7), 0.78 mM for N-phenyl-5-thio-D-glucopyranosylamine (8), 0.27 mM for p-nitro-N-phenyl-5-thio-D-glucopyranosylamine (9) and 0.87 mM for p-trifluoromethyl-N-phenyl-5-thio-D-glucopyranosylamine (10), and the K(m) values for the substrates maltose and p-nitrophenyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside are 1.2 and 3.7 mM, respectively. Methyl 4-amino-4-deoxy-4-N-(5'-thio-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-D-glucopyrano side (11) is a competitive inhibitor of GA wild-type (Ki 4 microM) and the active site mutant Trp120-->Phe GA (Ki 0.12 mM). Compounds 7, 8, and 11 are also competitive inhibitors of alpha-glucosidase from brewer's yeast, with Ki values of 1.05 mM, > 10 mM, and 0.5 mM, respectively. Molecular modeling of the inhibitors in the catalytic site of GA was used to probe the ligand-enzyme complementary interactions and to offer insight into the differences in inhibitory potencies of the ligands."

ANT-1 is a component of the mitochondrial permeability transition complex, a protein aggregate connecting the inner with the outer mitochondrial membrane that has recently been implicated in apoptosis. ANT-1 expression led to all features of apoptosis, such as phenotypic alterations, collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and DNA degradation. Both point mutations that impair ANT-1 in its known activity to transport ADP and ATP as well as the NH(2)-terminal half of the protein could still induce apoptosis. Interestingly, ANT-2, a highly homologous protein could not lead to cell death, demonstrating the specificity of the signal for apoptosis induction. In contrast to Bax, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 gene, ANT-1 was unable to elicit a form of cell death in yeast. This and the observed repression of apoptosis by the ANT-1-interacting protein cyclophilin D suggest that the suicidal effect of ANT-1 is mediated by specific protein-protein interactions within the permeability transition pore."

This model is supported by recent studies of pigment transport in several cell types and transport in neurons, and in several cases, class V myosin has been implicated as the actin-based motor. Mutations in mice (dilute) and yeast (myo2) have also implicated this class of myosin in organelle transport, and genetic interactions in yeast have indicated that a kinesin-related protein (Smy1p) plays a supporting role. This link between members of two different motor superfamilies has now taken a surprising turn: There is evidence for a physical interaction between class V myosins and kinesin or Smy1p in both mice and yeast."

In contrast, overexpression of Cdc6p, the budding yeast homolog of Cdc18p, does not cause re-replication in S. cerevisiae. However, we have found that Cdc6p has the ability to induce rereplication in fission yeast. Cdc6p cannot functionally replace Cdc18p, but instead interferes with the proteolysis of both Cdc18p and Rum1p, the inhibitor of the protein kinase Cdc2p. This activity of Cdc6p is entirely contained within a short N-terminal peptide, which forms a tight complex with Cdc2p and the F-box/WD-repeat protein Sud1p/Pop2p, a component of the SCF(Pop) ubiquitin ligase in fission yeast. These interactions are mediated by two distinct regions within the N-terminal region of Cdc6p and depend on the integrity of its Cdc2p phosphorylation sites. The data suggest that disruption of re-replication control by overexpression of Cdc6p in fission yeast is a consequence of sequestration of Cdc2p and Pop2p, two factors involved in the negative regulation of Rum1p, Cdc18p and potentially other replication proteins.",PMID: 10589835 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,602: Cell  1999 Nov 24;99(5):533-43

By screening a rabbit skeletal muscle cDNA library with residues 1-1059 of the alpha subunit of phosphorylase kinase, we have isolated 16 interacting, independent, yet overlapping transcripts of the alpha subunit containing its C-terminal region. Domain mapping of binary interactions between alpha constructs revealed two regions involved in the self-association of the alpha subunit: residues 833-854, a previously unrecognized leucine zipper, and an unspecified region within residues 1015-1237. The cognate binding partner for the latter domain has been inferred to lie within the stretch from residues 864-1059. Indirect evidence from the literature suggests that the interacting domains contained within the latter two, overlapping regions may be further narrowed to the stretches from 1057 to 1237 and from 864 to 971. Cross-linking of the nonactivated holoenzyme with N-(gamma-maleimidobutyroxy)sulfosuccin-imide ester produced intramolecularly cross-linked alpha-alpha dimers, consistent with portions of two alpha subunits in the holoenyzme being in sufficient proximity to associate.

At high defensin levels (10 to","40 microM), strong permeabilization was detected that could be strongly suppressed by cations in the medium. This permeabilization appears to rely on direct peptide-phospholipid interactions. At lower defensin levels (0.1 to 1 microM), a weaker, but more cation-resistant, permeabilization occurred at concentrations that correlated with the inhibition of fungal growth.

Dm-AMP1, a plant defensin from Dahlia merckii, induced cation-resistant membrane permeabilization in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) which correlated with its antifungal activity. However, Dm-AMP1 could not induce cation-resistant permeabilization in the Dm-AMP1-resistant S. cerevisiae mutant DM1, which has a drastically reduced capacity for binding Dm-AMP1.

Previous studies showed that the Sip1/Sip2/Gal83 component plays a structural role in the complex.

We show that Gal83 mediates the association of the kinase with Sip4, a Snf1-regulated transcription activator of gluconeogenic genes. Gal83 interacts with Sip4 in two-hybrid assays in vivo, and bacterially expressed proteins bind in vitro. Moreover, Gal83 is required for the two-hybrid interaction of Sip4 with the Snf1 kinase. Gal83 also facilitates the rapid Snf1-dependent phosphorylation and activation of Sip4 in response to glucose limitation, indicating that Gal83 mediates the functional interaction of Snf1 with Sip4. Evidence indicates that Sip1 and Sip2 do not interact with Sip4.

Both of these proteins are associated with the actin cytoskeleton in cells. To better establish the value of the I/LWEQ module for prediction of actin-binding function, we have applied a functional genomics approach. Analysis of the 23 available I/LWEQ module sequences supports the division of I/LWEQ protein superfamily into four groups: (1) metazoan talin, (2) Dictyostelium discoideum talin homologs TalA/B, (3) metazoan Hip1p, and (4) yeast Sla2p. We show here that I/LWEQ modules from each major group bind to F-actin in vitro and that GFP-fusion proteins of the I/LWEQ modules of talin and Sla2p bind to F-actin in vivo. Therefore, the presence of an I/LWEQ module is strongly predictive of protein-actin interactions. The structural and functional conservation of the I/LWEQ module across the phylogenetic distance between cellular slime molds and mammals implies that the role of the I/LWEQ module is to connect diverse proteins involved in distinct cellular processes, including cell adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, and cell differentiation, to the actin cytoskeleton.

Almost all eukaryotic DNA viruses contain binding sites for transcription factors which function as auxiliary elements for DNA replication initiation at replication origins, and, indeed, the binding of transcription factors to these elements has been shown to stimulate DNA replication. Transcription factors also regulate some of the chromosome DNA replication origins of budding yeast, indicating that transcription factor involvement in DNA replication is not restricted to viruses. Consistent with this notion, recently determined replication origins of higher eukaryotes have been found occasionally to associate with transcription factor binding sites, although there is no direct evidence for the involvement of the factors that bind to these sequences in DNA replication. Analyses using viral and yeast systems have suggested that transcription factors stimulate the formation of the replication initiation complex by engaging in specific interactions with proteins of the initiation complex and/or by modulating the repressive chromatin structure around origins of replication. These mechanisms are analogous to those advanced to explain stimulation of transcription by transcription factors. The accumulated data suggests that transcription factors play a general role in the formation of functional complexes on chromosomes.","Publication Types: Review Review, Tutorial"

However, in vitro assembly of a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex from purified yeast ribosomal protein L5 (also known as L1, L1a, or YL3) and 5S rRNA proved to be difficult, thus limiting the utility of this model. In the present report, we present data on the successful in vitro assembly of a RNP complex using a fusion (MBP-L5) protein consisting of the yeast ribosomal protein L5 fused to the carboxyl terminus of the E. coli maltose-binding protein (MBP). We demonstrated that: 1) the MBP-L5 protein binds yeast 5S rRNA but not 5.8S rRNA in vitro; 2) the MBP protein itself does not bind yeast 5S rRNA; 3) formation of the RNP complex is proportional to the concentration of MBP-L5 protein and 5S rRNA; and 4) the MBP moiety of the fusion protein in the RNP complex can be removed with factor Xa. The electrophoretic mobility of the resultant RNP complex is indistinguishable from that of L5-5S rRNA complex isolated from the ribosome. Using this new experimental approach, we further showed that the RNA binding capability of a mutant L5 protein is decreased by 60% compared to the wild-type protein. Additionally, the mutant RNP complex migrates slower than the wild-type RNP complex suggesting that the mutant RNP complex has a less compact conformation.

"DNA replication of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) during the productive phase of the life cycle of this herpesvirus depends on the cis-acting element oriLyt. It consists of two essential domains, the upstream and the downstream component. Whereas the upstream component contains several DNA-binding motifs for the viral activator protein BZLF1, the downstream component is known to be the binding site of several cellular proteins. We identified cellular transcription factors that bind synergistically to a functionally relevant subsequence of the downstream component, the TD element. Two of these transcription factors, ZBP-89 and Sp1, stimulate replication as shown by protein fusions with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and a single GAL4 DNA-binding motif inserted into the TD element. In protein binding assays, we observed an interaction of Sp1 and ZBP-89 with the viral DNA polymerase and its processivity factor. Our data indicate that cellular transcriptional activators tether viral replication proteins to the lytic origin via direct protein-protein interactions to assemble the viral replication complex at oriLyt.",PMID: 10545120 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,632: Toxicol Appl Pharmacol  1999 Nov 1;160(3):297-303 ,A human aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling pathway constructed in yeast displays additive responses to ligand mixtures.
"An optimized signal transduction pathway that reproduces the response of human aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor to ligands has been established in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ligand treatment induced a 50-fold increase in beta-galactosidase activity from a reporter plasmid in yeast engineered to express human Ah receptor and Ah nuclear translocator (Arnt) proteins. The archetypal Ah receptor ligand, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo(p)dioxin, activated Ah receptor and induced lacZ reporter activity at concentrations of >/=0.3 nM. Mixtures of halogenated and nonhalogenated Ah receptor ligands produced additive signaling responses in this yeast bioassay. These results were consistent with the existence of a common binding site and mechanism of ligand-mediated Ah receptor activation. Although yeast have no natural counterpart to the Ah receptor pathway, expression of human Ah receptor and Arnt under the appropriate conditions provides a functional model system for studying Ah receptor activation and signal transduction.

"Mitochondria are indispensable for normal eukaryotic cell function. As they cannot be synthesized de novo and are self-replicating, mitochondria must be transferred from mother to daughter cells. Studies in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicate that mitochondria enter the bud immediately after bud emergence, interact with the actin cytoskeleton for linear, polarized movement of mitochondria from mother to bud, but are equally distributed among mother and daughter cells [1] [2] [3]. It is not clear how the mother cell maintains its own supply of mitochondria. Here, we found that mother cells retain mitochondria by immobilization of some mitochondria in the 'retention zone', the base of the mother cell distal to the bud. Retention requires the actin cytoskeleton as mitochondria colocalized with actin cables in the retention zone, and mutations that perturb actin dynamics or actin-mitochondrial interactions produced retention defects. Our results support the model that equal distribution of mitochondria during cell division is a consequence of two actin-dependent processes: movement of some mitochondria into the daughter bud and immobilization of others in the mother cell.",PMID: 10531006 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,634: Appl Microbiol Biotechnol  1999 Sep;52(3):311-20 ,Yeast cells as tools for target-oriented screening.
"Information about biomolecular interaction networks is crucial for understanding cellular functions and the development of disease processes. Many diseases are known to be based on aberrations of DNA sequences encoding proteins with key functions in the cellular metabolism. Alterations in the respective proteins often lead to disturbances in biomolecular interactions caused by unbalanced stoichiometries, and thus result in alterations of molecule fluxes, cell architecture and signalling pathways. Drug discovery programmes have been designed to find promising chemical lead structures with the help of target-oriented bioassay systems. These are, in most cases, based upon the interaction of small molecules to specific macromolecular targets in vivo or in vitro, as exemplified by enzyme assays or small-ligand-based receptor systems. In addition, interactions between large biomolecules, such as proteins or nucleic acids, offer a huge arsenal of potential drug targets that can be addressed by small chemical compounds. This latter approach is gaining considerable attention because many potential target structures are becoming available through genomic research. Funnelling these new targets into high-throughput screening programs represents a major challenge for today's pharmaceutical research. An important outcome of the ongoing genome projects is the fact that the basic cellular structures, pathways and signalling principles show a high degree of conservation. Model organisms that are easily approachable by genetic, biochemical and physiological means can thus play an important role in the design of target-oriented screening systems. They offer the possibility to express individual proteins, nucleic acids or even more complex aggregates of biomolecules such as protein-interaction networks or transcription-initiation complexes, which can be addressed by small effector molecules in vivo. Combining these targets with biological signalling systems is an attractive way of creating robust cellular assay systems.","Publication Types: Review Review, Tutorial",PMID: 10531642 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,635: Infect Immun  1999 Nov;67(11):6040-7 
"Department of Research, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Kansas City, Missouri 64128, USA. nkgaur@kuhub.cc.ukans.edu","Candida albicans maintains a commensal relationship with human hosts, probably by adhering to mucosal tissue in a variety of physiological conditions. We show that adherence due to the C. albicans gene ALA1 when transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is comprised of two sequential steps. Initially, C. albicans rapidly attaches to extracellular matrix (ECM) protein-coated magnetic beads in small numbers (the attachment phase). This is followed by a relatively slower step in which cell-to-cell interactions predominate (the aggregation phase). Neither of these phases is observed in S. cerevisiae. However, expression of the C. albicans ALA1 gene from a low-copy vector causes S. cerevisiae transformants to attach to ECM-coated magnetic beads without appreciable aggregation. Expression of ALA1 from a high-copy vector results in both attachment and aggregation. Moreover, transcriptional fusion of ALA1 with the galactose-inducible promoters GALS, GALL, and GAL1, allowing for low, moderate, and high levels of inducible transcription, respectively, causes attachment and aggregation that correlates with the strength of the GAL promoter. The adherence of C. albicans and S. cerevisiae overexpressing ALA1 to a number of protein ligands occurs over a broad pH range, is resistant to shear forces generated by vortexing, and is unaffected by the presence of sugars, high salt levels, free ligands, or detergents. Adherence is, however, inhibited by agents that disrupt hydrogen bonds. The similarities in the adherence and aggregation properties of C. albicans and S. cerevisiae overexpressing ALA1 suggest a role in adherence and aggregation for ALA1 and ALA1-like genes in C. albicans.",PMID: 10531265 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,636: Methods  1999 Oct;19(2):338-49

The best characterised components of the human NER process are those proteins defective in the inherited disorder xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). The proteins known to be involved in the first steps of the NER reaction (damage recognition and incision-excision) are heterotrimeric RPA, XPA, the 6 to 9 subunit TFIIH, XPC-hHR23B, XPG, and ERCC1-XPF. Many interactions between these proteins have been found in recent years using different methods both in mammalian cells and for the homologous proteins in yeast. There are virtually no quantitative measurements of the relative strengths of these interactions. Higher order associations between these proteins in solution and even the existence of a complete ""repairosome"" complex have been reported, which would have implications both for the mechanism of repair and for the interplay between NER and other cellular processes. Nevertheless, evidence for a completely pre-assembled functional repairosome in solution is inconclusive and the order of action of repair factors on damaged DNA is uncertain.","Publication Types: Review Review, Tutorial",PMID: 10526214 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

The MMS2 gene is the only known yeast gene involved in error-free PRR that, when mutated, significantly increases the spontaneous mutation rate. In this study, the mutational spectrum of the mms2 mutator was determined and compared to the wild type strain. In addition, mutagenenic effects and genetic interactions of the mms2 mutator and rev3 anti-mutator were examined with respect to forward mutations, frameshift reversions as well as amber and ochre suppressions. It was concluded from these results that the mms2 mutator phenotype is largely dependent on the functional REV3 gene. The synergistic effects of mms2 and rev3 mutations towards killing by a variety of DNA-damaging agents ruled out the possibility that MMS2 simply acts to suppress REV3 activity and favored the hypothesis that MMS2 and REV3 form two alternative subpathways within the RAD6 DNA repair pathway. Taken together, we propose that two pathways represented by MMS2 and REV3 deal with a similar range of endogenous and environmental DNA damage but with different biological consequences, namely, error-free repair and mutagenesis, respectively.",PMID: 10526212 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

The length of these repeats is kept within a defined range by regulators such as the TEL2-encoded protein (Tel2p). Here we show that Tel2p can specifically bind to single-stranded TG(1-3). Tel2p binding produced several shifted bands; however, only the slowest migrating band contained Tel2p. Methylation protection and interference experiments as well as gel shift experiments using inosine-containing probes indicated that the faster migrating bands resulted from Tel2p-mediated formation of DNA secondary structures held together by G-G interactions. Tel2p bound to single-stranded substrates that were at least 19 bases in length and contained 14 bases of TG(1-3), and also to double-stranded/single-stranded hybrid substrates with a 3' TG(1-3) overhang. Tel2p binding to a hybrid substrate with a 24 base single-stranded TG(1-3) extension also produced a band characteristic of G-G-mediated secondary structures.

To build and try this system that we called RNP interaction trap assay (RITA), we used as a model the autoantigenic Ro RNPs. hY RNAs bear distinct binding sites for Ro60 and La proteins, and Ro RNPs are thus physiologically tripartite (Ro60/hY RNA/La). Using recombinant La (rLa) and Ro60 (rRo60) proteins and recombinant hY RNAs (rhY) co-expressed in yeast, we found that RNPs made of rRo60/rhY/rLa were readily reassembled. Reconstitution of tripartite RNPs was critically dependent on the presence of an appropriate Ro60 binding site on the recombinant RNA. The RITA assay was further used to detect (rRo60/rhY RNP)-binding proteins from a HeLa cell cDNA library, allowing specific identification of La and of a novel Ro RNP-binding protein (RoBPI) in more than 70% of positive clones.

An RNA binding motif in the Cbp2 protein required for protein-stimulated RNA catalysis.,"Tirupati HK, Shaw LC, Lewin AS.","Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, Florida 32605, USA.","The fifth and terminal intron of yeast cytochrome b pre-mRNA (a group I intron) requires a protein encoded by the nuclear gene CBP2 for splicing. Because catalysis is intrinsic to the RNA, the protein is believed to promote formation of secondary and tertiary structure of the RNA, resulting in a catalytically competent intron. In vitro, this mitochondrial intron can be made to self-splice or undergo protein-facilitated splicing by varying the Mg(2+) and monovalent salt concentrations. This two-component system, therefore, provides a good model for understanding the role of proteins in RNA folding. A UV cross-linking experiment was initiated to identify RNA binding sites on Cbp2 and gain insights into Cbp2-intron interactions. A 12-amino acid region containing a presumptive contact site near the amino terminus was targeted for mutagenesis, and mutant proteins were characterized for RNA binding and stimulation of splicing. Mutations in this region resulted in partial or complete loss of function, demonstrating the importance of this determinant for stimulation of RNA splicing. Several of the mutations that severely reduced splicing did not significantly shift the overall binding isotherm of Cbp2 for the precursor RNA, suggesting that contacts critical for activity are not necessarily reflected in the dissociation constant.

Little is known about the chemical nature and localization of other mitochondrial targeting signals or of the mechanisms by which they facilitate membrane passage. Mitochondrial heme lyases lack N-terminal targeting information. These proteins are localized in the intermembrane space and are essential for the covalent attachment of heme to c type cytochromes. For import of heme lyases, the translocase of the mitochondrial outer membrane complex is both necessary and sufficient. Here, we report the identification of the targeting signal of mitochondrial heme lyases in the third quarter of these proteins. The targeting sequence is highly conserved among all known heme lyases. Its chemical character is hydrophilic because of a large fraction of both positively and negatively charged amino acid residues. These features clearly distinguish this signal from classical presequences. When inserted into a cytosolic protein, the targeting sequence directs the fusion protein into the intermembrane space, even in the absence of a membrane potential or ATP hydrolysis. The heme lyase targeting sequence represents the first topogenic signal for energy-independent transport into the intermembrane space and harbors two types of information. It assures accurate recognition and translocation by the translocase of the mitochondrial outer membrane complex, and it is responsible for driving the import reaction by undergoing high-affinity interactions with components of the intermembrane space.",PMID: 10518522 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

Results are presented showing how the feasible space for operation can be simulated and used both to address key design and operating decisions and to identify suitable trade-offs between operating variables, such as fermentation growth rate and disruption conditions, in order to achieve prespecified levels of process performance. Using verified models to describe the production and isolation of an intracellular protein alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in yeast as a test bed, a series of so-called ""windows of operation"" are developed at growth rates in the range of 0.06-0.28 h(-1) and for a range of overall process specifications. The effects of altering the process design performance specification as defined by the level of cell debris removal and the overall process productivity on the size and position of the feasible space were investigated to demonstrate the sensitivity of the flowsheet to changes in process objectives. Using the approach it has been possible to visualise the processing trade-offs required to increase performance in terms of the level of cell debris removal by 50% and the overall process productivity by 400% from a defined base level. The approach provides a convenient tool when designing integrated bioprocesses by enabling process options to be compared visually and can help in achieving better process designs and accelerating process development for the biological process industry.

Phospholipase C binds to the receptor-like GPR1 protein and controls pseudohyphal differentiation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"Ansari K, Martin S, Farkasovsky M, Ehbrecht IM, Kuntzel H.","Max-Planck-Institut fur Experimentelle Medizin, Hermann-Rein-Strasse 3, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany.","The hormone receptor-like protein Gpr1p physically interacts with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (Plc1p) and with the Galpha protein Gpa2p, as shown by two-hybrid assays and co-immune precipitation of epitope-tagged proteins. Plc1p binds to Gpr1p in either the presence or absence of Gpa2, whereas the Gpr1p/Gpa2p association depends on the presence of Plc1p. Genetic interactions between the null mutations plc1Delta, gpr1Delta, gpa2Delta, and ras2Delta suggest that Plc1p acts together with Gpr1p and Gpa2p in a growth control pathway operating in parallel to the Ras2p function. Diploid cells lacking Gpr1p, Plc1p, or Gpa2p fail to form pseudohyphae upon nitrogen depletion, and the filamentation defect of gpr1Delta and plc1Delta strains is rescued by activating a mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway via STE11-4 or by activating a cAMP pathway via overexpressed Tpk2p. Plc1p is also required for efficient expression of the FG(TyA)::lacZ reporter gene under nitrogen depletion. In conclusion, we have identified two physically interacting proteins, Gpr1p and Plc1p, as novel components of a nitrogen signaling pathway controlling the developmental switch from yeast-like to pseudohyphal growth. Our data suggest that phospholipase C modulates the interaction of the putative nutrient sensor Gpr1p with the Galpha protein Gpa2p as a downstream effector of filamentation control.",PMID: 10514491 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Association of the cell cycle transcription factor Mbp1 with the Skn7 response regulator in budding yeast.,"Bouquin N, Johnson AL, Morgan BA, Johnston LH.","Division of Yeast Genetics, National Institute for Medical Research, The Ridgeway, Mill Hill, London NW7 1AA, United Kingdom.","We previously isolated the SKN7 gene in a screen designed to isolate new components of the G1-S cell cycle transcription machinery in budding yeast. We have now found that Skn7 associates with Mbp1, the DNA-binding component of the G1-S transcription factor DSC1/MBF. SKN7 and MBP1 show several genetic interactions. Skn7 overexpression is lethal and is suppressed by a mutation in MBP1. Similarly, high overexpression of Mbp1 is lethal and can be suppressed by skn7 mutations. SKN7 is also required for MBP1 function in a mutant compromised for G1-specific transcription. Gel-retardation assays indicate that Skn7 is not an integral part of MBF. However, a physical interaction between Skn7 and Mbp1 was detected using two-hybrid assays and GST pulldowns. Thus, Skn7 and Mbp1 seem to form a transcription factor independent of MBF. Genetic data suggest that this new transcription factor could be involved in the bud-emergence process.",PMID: 10512874 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
An NMR analysis of ubiquitin recognition by yeast ubiquitin hydrolase: evidence for novel substrate recognition by a cysteine protease.,"Sakamoto T, Tanaka T, Ito Y, Rajesh S, Iwamoto-Sugai M, Kodera Y, Tsuchida N, Shibata T, Kohno T.","Mitsubishi Kasei Institute of Life Sciences, Machida, Tokyo 194-8511, Japan.","Yeast ubiquitin hydrolase 1 (YUH1), a cysteine protease that catalyzes the removal of ubiquitin C-terminal adducts, is important for the generation of monomeric ubiquitin. Heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy has been utilized to map the YUH1 binding surface on ubiquitin. When YUH1 was titrated into a sample of ubiquitin, approximately 50% of the (1)H-(15)N correlation peaks of ubiquitin were affected to some degree, as a result of binding to YUH1. It is noteworthy that the amide resonances of the basic residues (Arg42, Lys48, Arg72, and Lys74) were highly perturbed. These positively charged basic residues may be involved in direct interactions with the negatively charged acidic residues on YUH1. In addition to the electrostatic surface, the hydrophobic surfaces on ubiquitin (Leu8, Ile44, Phe45, Val70, Leu71, and Leu73) and YUH1 are also likely to contribute to the binding interaction. Furthermore, the amide resonances of Ile13, Leu43, Leu50, and Leu69, the side chains of which are not on the surface, were also highly perturbed, indicating substrate-induced changes in the environments of these residues as well. These large changes, observed from residues located throughout the five-stranded beta-sheet surface and the C-terminus, suggest that substrate recognition by YUH1 involves a wider area on ubiquitin.",PMID: 10512618 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Influence of protein environment on magnetic circular dichroism spectral properties of ferric and ferrous ligand complexes of yeast cytochrome c peroxidase.,"Pond AE, Sono M, Elenkova EA, Goodin DB, English AM, Dawson JH.","Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of South Carolina, Columbia 29208, USA.","The addition of exogenous ligands to the ferric and ferrous states of yeast cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP) is investigated with magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) at 4 degrees C to determine the effect the protein environment may exercise on spectral properties. The MCD spectrum of each derivative is directly compared to those of analogous forms of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and myoglobin (Mb), two well-characterized histidine-ligated heme proteins. The ferric azide adduct of CCP is a hexacoordinate, largely low-spin species with an MCD spectrum very similar to that of ferric azide HRP. This complex displays an MCD spectrum dissimilar from that of the Mb derivative, possibly because of the stabilizing interaction between the azide ligand and the distal arginine of CCP (Arg 48). For the ferric fluoride derivative all three proteins display varied MCD data, indicating that the differences in the distal pocket of each protein influences their respective MCD characteristics. The MCD data for the cyanoferric complexes are similar for all three proteins, demonstrating that a strong field ligand bound in the sixth axial position dominates the MCD characteristics of the derivative. Similarly, the ferric NO complexes of the three proteins show MCD spectra similar in feature position and shape, but vary somewhat in intensity. Reduction of CCP at neutral pH yields a typical pentacoordinate high-spin complex with an MCD spectrum similar to that of deoxyferrous HRP. Formation of the NO and cyanide complexes of ferrous CCP gives derivatives with MCD spectra similar to the analogous forms of HRP and Mb in both feature position and shape. Addition of CO to deoxyferrous CCP results in a ferrous-CO complex with MCD spectral similarity to that of ferrous-CO HRP but not Mb, indicating that interactions between the ligand and the distal residues affects the MCD characteristics. Examination of alkaline (pH 9.7) deoxyferrous CCP indicates that a pH dependent conformational change has occurred, leading to a coordination structure similar to that of ferrous cytochrome b5, a known bis-histidine complex. Exposure of this complex to CO further confirms that a conformational change has taken place in that the MCD spectral characteristics of the resulting complex are similar to those of ferrous-CO Mb but not ferrous-CO HRP.",PMID: 10512537 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Mutational analysis of yeast TFIIB. A functional relationship between Ssu72 and Sub1/Tsp1 defined by allele-specific interactions with TFIIB.,"Wu WH, Pinto I, Chen BS, Hampsey M.","Department of Biochemistry, Louisiana State University Medical Center, Shreveport, Louisiana 71130, USA.","TFIIB is an essential component of the RNA polymerase II core transcriptional machinery. Previous studies have defined TFIIB domains required for interaction with other transcription factors and for basal transcription in vitro. In the study reported here we investigated the TFIIB structural requirements for transcription initiation in vivo. A library of sua7 mutations encoding altered forms of yeast TFIIB was generated by error-prone polymerase chain reaction and screened for conditional growth defects. Twenty-two single amino acid replacements in TFIIB were defined and characterized. These replacements are distributed throughout the protein and occur primarily at phylogenetically conserved positions. Most replacements have little or no effect on the steady-state protein levels, implying that each affects TFIIB function rather than synthesis or stability. In contrast to the initial sua7 mutants, all replacements, with one exception, have no effect on start site selection, indicating that specific TFIIB structural defects affect transcriptional accuracy. This collection of sua7 alleles, including the initial sua7 alleles, was used to investigate the allele specificity of interactions between ssu72 and sub1, both of which were initially identified as either suppressors (SUB1 2mu) or enhancers (sub1Delta, ssu72-1) of sua7 mutations. We show that the interactions of ssu72-1 and sub1Delta with sua7 are allele specific; that the allele specificities of ssu72 and sub1 overlap; and that each of the sua7 alleles that interacts with ssu72 and sub1 affects the accuracy of transcription start site selection. These results demonstrate functional interactions among TFIIB, Ssu72, and Sub1 and suggest that these interactions play a role in the mechanism of start site selection by RNA polymerase II.",PMID: 10511545 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

A positive transcription factor, Mac1p binds via its N-terminal domain to GCTC elements in the promoters of CTR1 and FRE1, encoding a copper permease and metal reductase, respectively. Mac1p-dependent transcriptional activation is negatively regulated by copper. We have mapped the domains in Mac1p responsible for its nuclear localization and for the protein-protein interactions that underlie its transcriptional activity. Immunofluorescence studies indicate that Mac1p contains two nuclear localization signals, one each in the N- and C-terminal halves of the protein. Yeast one-hybrid analysis demonstrates that the copper-dependent transcriptional activity in Mac1p resides primarily in a cysteine-rich element encompassing residues 264-279. Two-hybrid analysis indicates that a copper-independent Mac1p-Mac1p interaction linked to DNA binding is due primarily to a predicted helix in the C-terminal region of the protein encompassing residues 388-406. Point mutations within this putative helix abrogate the Mac1-Mac1 interaction in vivo and formation of a ternary (Mac1p)(2).DNA complex in vitro. When produced in normal abundance, Mac1pI396D and Mac1pF400D helix mutants do not support transcriptional activation in vivo consistent with an essential Mac1p dimerization in transcriptional activation. Lastly, the one- and two-hybrid data indicate that an intramolecular interaction between the DNA-binding and transactivation domains negatively modulates Mac1p activity.",PMID: 10506178 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Reconstitution of fibroblast growth factor receptor interactions in the yeast two hybrid system.,"Aloni-Grinstein R, Seddon A, Yayon A.","Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.","Fibroblast growth factors (FGF) activate their receptors through the formation of trimolecular complexes, composed of a ligand, a receptor, and a heparan sulfate oligosaccharide, all of which are members of particularly large families capable of multiple interactions in a combinatorial fashion. Understanding this large network of interactions not only presents a great challenge, but is practically beyond the capacity of most classical techniques routinely used to study ligand receptor interactions. We have used the yeast two hybrid system to study protein-protein interactions in the FGF family. Both ligand and receptor ectodomains are properly folded and functional in the yeast. Basic FGF (bFGF) expressed in the yeast dimerizes spontaneously. This self-assembly occurs at low affinity, which can be greatly enhanced by the introduction of heparin, supporting a defined role for heparin in bFGF dimerization. Screening a rat embryo cDNA library with bFGF in the yeast two hybrid system identified a short variant of FGF receptor 1, found most frequently in embryonal and tumor cells and which possesses affinity toward bFGF that is significantly greater than that of the more abundant, full-length receptor. We find the yeast two hybrid system, a most suitable alternative method for the analysis of growth factor-receptor interactions as well as for screening for novel interacting proteins and modulators of FGF and its receptors.",PMID: 10503237 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

In addition to finding, not surprisingly, that mutations in major cell wall-related genes such as FKS1 (glucan synthase) and mutations in any of the Golgi glycosylation complex genes (MNN9 family) are lethal in combination with chs3Delta, we found that a mutation in Srv2p, a bifunctional regulatory gene, is notably lethal in the chs3 deletion. In extending studies of fks1-chitin synthase 3 interactions, we made the surprising discovery that deletion of CSD3/CHS6, a gene normally required for Chs3p delivery and activity in vivo, was not lethal with fks1 and, in fact, that lack of Csd3p/Chs6p did not decrease the high level of stress-related chitin made in the fks1 mutant.

X-ray crystal structures of active site mutants of the vanadium-containing chloroperoxidase from the fungus Curvularia inaequalis.,"Macedo-Ribeiro S, Hemrika W, Renirie R, Wever R, Messerschmidt A.","Max-Planck Institut fur Biochemie, Abteilung Strukturforschung, Martinsried, Germany.","The X-ray structures of the chloroperoxidase from Curvularia inaequalis, heterologously expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have been determined both in its apo and in its holo forms at 1.66 and 2.11 A resolution, respectively. The crystal structures reveal that the overall structure of this enzyme remains nearly unaltered, particularly at the metal binding site. At the active site of the apo-chloroperoxidase structure a clearly defined sulfate ion was found, partially stabilised through electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds with positively charged residues involved in the interactions with the vanadate in the native protein. The vanadate binding pocket seems to form a very rigid frame stabilising oxyanion binding. The rigidity of this active site matrix is the result of a large number of hydrogen bonding interactions involving side chains and the main chain of residues lining the active site. The structures of single site mutants to alanine of the catalytic residue His404 and the vanadium protein ligand His496 have also been analysed. Additionally we determined the structural effects of mutations to alanine of residue Arg360, directly involved in the compensation of the negative charge of the vanadate group, and of residue Asp292 involved in forming a salt bridge with Arg490 which also interacts with the vanadate. The enzymatic chlorinating activity is drastically reduced to approximately 1% in mutants D292A, H404A and H496A. The structures of the mutants confirm the view of the active site of this chloroperoxidase as a rigid matrix providing an oxyanion binding site. No large changes are observed at the active site for any of the analysed mutants. The empty space left by replacement of large side chains by alanines is usually occupied by a new solvent molecule which partially replaces the hydrogen bonding interactions to the vanadate. The new solvent molecules additionally replace part of the interactions the mutated side chains were making to other residues lining the active site frame. When this is not possible, another side chain in the proximity of the mutated residue moves in order to satisfy the hydrogen bonding potential of the residues located at the active site frame.",PMID: 10499093 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Isolation of the protein kinase TAO2 and identification of its mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase binding domain.,"Chen Z, Hutchison M, Cobb MH.","Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75235-9041, USA.","We previously reported the cloning of the thousand and one-amino acid protein kinase 1 (TAO1), a rat homolog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein kinase sterile 20 protein. Here we report the complete sequence and properties of a related rat protein kinase TAO2. Like TAO1, recombinant TAO2 selectively activated mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinases (MEKs) 3, 4, and 6 of the stress-responsive mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in vitro and copurified with MEK3 endogenous to Sf9 cells. To examine TAO2 interactions with MEKs, the MEK binding domain of TAO2 was localized to an approximately 135-residue sequence just C-terminal to the TAO2 catalytic domain. In vitro this MEK binding domain associated with MEKs 3 and 6 but not MEKs 1, 2, or 4. Using chimeric MEK proteins, we found that the MEK N terminus was sufficient for binding to TAO2. Catalytic activity of full-length TAO2 enhanced its binding to MEKs. However, neither the autophosphorylation of the MEK binding domain of TAO2 nor the activity of MEK itself was required for MEK binding. These results suggest that TAO proteins lie in stress-sensitive kinase cascades and define a mechanism by which these kinases may organize downstream targets.",PMID: 10497253 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

Species-specific differences were observed for calcium-promoted DNA cleavage. Similarities and differences in DNA cleavage patterns and nucleic acid sequence preferences were also observed between the human, yeast, and E. coli top2 enzymes in the presence of the non-intercalators fluoroquinolone CP-115,953, etoposide, and azatoxin and the intercalators amsacrine and mitoxantrone. Additional base preferences were generally observed for the yeast when compared with the human top2alpha enzyme. Preferences in the immediate flanks of the top2-mediated DNA cleavage sites are, however, consistent with the drug stacking model for both enzymes. We also analyzed and compared homologous mutations in yeast and human top2, i.e. Ser(740) --> Trp and Ser(763) --> Trp, respectively. Both mutations decreased the reversibility of the etoposide-stabilized cleavage sites and produced consistent base sequence preference changes. These data demonstrate similarities and differences between human and yeast top2 enzymes. They also indicate that the structure of the enzyme/DNA interface plays a key role in determining the specificity of top2 poisons and cleavage sites for both the intercalating and non-intercalating drugs.",PMID: 10497180 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Regulation of cell cycle transcription factor Swi4 through auto-inhibition of DNA binding.,"Baetz K, Andrews B.","Department of Molecular and Medical Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S 1A8.","In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two transcription factors, SBF (SCB binding factor) and MBF (MCB binding factor), promote the induction of gene expression at the G(1)/S-phase transition of the mitotic cell cycle. Swi4 and Mbp1 are the DNA binding components of SBF and MBF, respectively. The Swi6 protein is a common subunit of both transcription factors and is presumed to play a regulatory role. SBF binding to its target sequences, the SCBs, is a highly regulated event and requires the association of Swi4 with Swi6 through their C-terminal domains. Swi4 binding to SCBs is restricted to the late M and G(1) phases, when Swi6 is localized to the nucleus. We show that in contrast to Swi6, Swi4 remains nuclear throughout the cell cycle. This finding suggests that the DNA binding domain of Swi4 is inaccessible in the full-length protein when not complexed with Swi6. To explore this hypothesis, we expressed Swi4 and Swi6 in insect cells by using the baculovirus system. We determined that partially purified Swi4 cannot bind SCBs in the absence of Swi6. However, Swi4 derivatives carrying point mutations or alterations in the extreme C terminus were able to bind DNA or activate transcription in the absence of Swi6, and the C terminus of Swi4 inhibited Swi4 derivatives from binding DNA in trans. Full-length Swi4 was determined to be monomeric in solution, suggesting an intramolecular mechanism for auto-inhibition of binding to DNA by Swi4. We detected a direct in vitro interaction between a C-terminal fragment of Swi4 and the N-terminal 197 amino acids of Swi4, which contain the DNA binding domain. Together, our data suggest that intramolecular interactions involving the C-terminal region of Swi4 physically prevent the DNA binding domain from binding SCBs. The interaction of the carboxy-terminal region of Swi4 with Swi6 alleviates this inhibition, allowing Swi4 to bind DNA.",PMID: 10490612 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
"The CCR4 and CAF1 proteins of the CCR4-NOT complex are physically and functionally separated from NOT2, NOT4, and NOT5.","Bai Y, Salvadore C, Chiang YC, Collart MA, Liu HY, Denis CL.","Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of New Hampshire, Durham, New Hampshire 03824, USA.","The CCR4-NOT complex (1 mDa in size), consisting of the proteins CCR4, CAF1, and NOT1 to NOT5, regulates gene expression both positively and negatively and is distinct from other large transcriptional complexes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae such as SNF/SWI, TFIID, SAGA, and RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. The physical and genetic interactions between the components of the CCR4-NOT complex were investigated in order to gain insight into how this complex affects the expression of diverse genes and processes. The CAF1 protein was found to be absolutely required for CCR4 association with the NOT proteins, and CCR4 and CAF1, in turn, physically interacted with NOT1 through its central amino acid region from positions 667 to 1152. The NOT3, NOT4, and NOT5 proteins had no significant effect on the association of CCR4, CAF1, and NOT1 with each other. In contrast, the NOT2, NOT4, and NOT5 interacted with the C-terminal region (residues 1490 to 2108) of NOT1 in which NOT2 and NOT5 physically associated in the absence of CAF1, NOT3, and NOT4. These and other data indicate that the physical ordering of these proteins in the complex is CCR4-CAF1-NOT1-(NOT2, NOT5), with NOT4 and NOT3 more peripheral to NOT2 and NOT5. The physical separation of CCR4 and CAF1 from other components of the CCR4-NOT complex correlated with genetic analysis indicating partially separate functions for these two groups of proteins. ccr4 or caf1 deletion suppressed the increased 3-aminotriazole resistance phenotype conferred by not mutations, resulted in opposite effects on gene expression as compared to several not mutations, and resulted in a number of synthetic phenotypes in combination with not mutations.

One set of SL interactions was due to mutations that were complemented by components of U1 small nuclear RNP (snRNP) and the yeast splicing commitment complex. These interactions confirm the role of yCBC in commitment complex formation. Physical interaction of yCBC with the commitment complex components Mud10p and Mud2p, which may directly mediate yCBC function, was demonstrated. Unexpectedly, we identified multiple SL mutations that were complemented by Cbf5p and Nop58p. These are components of the two major classes of yeast small nucleolar RNPs, which function in the maturation of rRNA precursors. Mutants lacking yCBC were found to be defective in rRNA processing. Analysis of the yCBC deletion phenotype suggests that this is likely to be due to a defect in the splicing of a subset of ribosomal protein mRNA precursors.",PMID: 10490594 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

Genetic interactions between a null allele of the RIT1 gene encoding an initiator tRNA-specific modification enzyme and genes encoding translation factors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"Astrom SU, Nordlund ME, Erickson FL, Hannig EM, Bystrom AS.","Department of Microbiology, Umea University, Sweden.","The Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene RIT1 encodes a phospho-ribosyl transferase that exclusively modifies the initiator tRNA (tRNAMet(i)) by the addition of a 2'-O-ribosyl phosphate group to Adenosine 64. As a result, tRNAMet(i) is prevented from participating in the elongation steps of protein synthesis. We previously showed that the modification is not essential for the function of tRNAMet(i) in the initiation of translation, since rit1 null strains are viable and show no obvious growth defects. Here, we demonstrate that yeast strains in which a rit1 null allele is combined with mutations in any of the genes for the three subunits of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2), or with disruption alleles of two of the four initiator methionine tRNA (IMT) genes, show synergistic growth defects. A multicopy plasmid carrying an IMT gene can alleviate these defects. On the other hand, introduction of a high-copy-number plasmid carrying the TEF2 gene, which encodes the eukaryotic elongation factor 1alpha (eEF-1alpha), into rit1 null strains with two intact IMT genes had the opposite effect, indicating that increased levels of eEF-1alpha are deleterious to these strains, presumably due to sequestration of the unmodified met-tRNAMet(i) for elongation. Thus, under conditions in which the components of the ternary met-tRNAMet(i):GTP:eIF-2 complex become limiting or are functionally impaired, the presence of the 2'-O-ribosyl phosphate modification in tRNAMet(i) is important for the provision of adequate amounts of tRNAMet(i) for formation of this ternary complex.",PMID: 10485288 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
The Drosophila caspase inhibitor DIAP1 is essential for cell survival and is negatively regulated by HID.,"Wang SL, Hawkins CJ, Yoo SJ, Muller HA, Hay BA.","Division of Biology MC 156-29, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena 91125, USA.","Drosophila Reaper (RPR), Head Involution Defective (HID), and GRIM induce caspase-dependent cell death and physically interact with the cell death inhibitor DIAP1.

Based on these results, we propose that RPR, HID, and GRIM promote apoptosis by disrupting productive IAP-caspase interactions and that DIAP1 is required to block apoptosis-inducing caspase activity. Supporting this hypothesis, we show that elimination of DIAP1 function results in global early embryonic cell death and a large increase in DIAP1-inhibitable caspase activity and that DIAP1 is still required for cell survival when expression of rpr, hid, and grim is eliminated.",PMID: 10481910 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Coactivators for the orphan nuclear receptor RORalpha.,"Atkins GB, Hu X, Guenther MG, Rachez C, Freedman LP, Lazar MA.","Department of Medicine, The Penn Diabetes Center, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104-6149, USA.","A mutation in the nuclear orphan receptor RORalpha results in a severe impairment of cerebellar development by unknown mechanisms. We have shown previously that RORalpha contains a strong constitutive activation domain in its C terminus. We therefore searched for mammalian RORalpha coactivators using the minimal activation domain as bait in a two-hybrid screen. Several known and putative coactivators were isolated, including glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein-1 (GRIP-1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-binding protein (PBP/TRAP220/DRIP205). These interactions were confirmed in vitro and require the intact activation domain of RORalpha although different requirements for interaction with GRIP-1 and PBP were detected. Even in the absence of exogenous ligand, RORalpha interacts with a complex or complexes of endogenous proteins, similar to those that bind to ligand-occupied thyroid hormone and vitamin D receptors. Both PBP and GRIP-1 were shown to be present in these complexes. Thus we have identified several potential RORalpha coactivators that, in contrast to the interactions with hormone receptors, interact with RORalpha in yeast, in bacterial extracts, and in mammalian cells in vivo and in vitro in the absence of exogenous ligand. GRIP-1 functioned as a coactivator for the RORalpha both in yeast and in mammalian cells. Thus, GRIP-1 is the first proven coactivator for RORalpha.",PMID: 10478845 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
"Tpr1, a Schizosaccharomyces pombe protein involved in potassium transport.","Lichtenberg H, Heyer M, Hofer M.","Botanisches Institut der Universitat Bonn, Kirschallee 1, 53115, Bonn, Germany. H.Lichtenberg@uni-bonn.de","The Schizosaccharomyces pombe Tpr1 was isolated as suppressor of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Delta trk1,2 potassium uptake deficient phenotype. Tpr1, for tetratrico peptide repeat, encodes a 1039 amino acid residues protein with several reiterated TPR units displaying significant homology to p150(TSP), a recently identified phosphoprotein of mouse, to S. cerevisiae CTR9 and to related sequences of human, Caenorhabditis elegans, Methanoccocus jannaschii and Arabidopsis thaliana. Expression of Tpr1 restored growth on 0.2 mM K(+) media, induced K(+) transport with a K(T) of 4.6 mM and resumed inward currents of -90 pA at -250 mV (pH 7.2) conducting K(+) and other alkali-metal ions. The tetratrico peptide repeat is a degenerate motif of 34 amino acids that is repeated several times within TPR-containing proteins and has been suggested to mediate protein-protein interactions. The sequence and putative binding properties of Tpr1 suggest the protein unlikely as transporter but involved in the enhancement of K(+) uptake via conventional carriers.",PMID: 10471809 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Genetic study of interactions between the cytoskeletal assembly protein sla1 and prion-forming domain of the release factor Sup35 (eRF3) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"Bailleul PA, Newnam GP, Steenbergen JN, Chernoff YO.","School of Biology, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30332-0230, USA.","Striking similarities between cytoskeletal assembly and the ""nucleated polymerization"" model of prion propagation suggest that similar or overlapping sets of proteins may assist in both processes. We show that the C-terminal domain of the yeast cytoskeletal assembly protein Sla1 (Sla1C) specifically interacts with the N-terminal prion-forming domain (Sup35N) of the yeast release factor Sup35 (eRF3) in the two-hybrid system. Sla1C and several other Sup35N-interacting proteins also exhibit two-hybrid interactions with the poly-Gln-expanded N-proximal fragment of human huntingtin, which promotes Huntington disease-associated aggregation. The Sup35N-Sla1C interaction is inhibited by Sup35N alterations that make Sup35 unable to propagate the [PSI(+)] state and by the absence of the chaperone protein Hsp104, which is essential for [PSI] propagation. In a Sla1(-) background, [PSI] curing by dimethylsulfoxide or excess Hsp104 is increased, while translational readthrough and de novo [PSI] formation induced by excess Sup35 or Sup35N are decreased. These data show that, in agreement with the proposed function of Sla1 during cytoskeletal formation, Sla1 assists in [PSI] formation and propagation, but is not required for these processes. Sla1(-) strains are sensitive to some translational inhibitors, and some sup35 mutants, obtained in a Sla1(-) background, are sensitive to Sla1, suggesting that the interaction between Sla1 and Sup35 proteins may play a role in the normal function of the translational apparatus. We hypothesize that Sup35N is involved in regulatory interactions with intracellular structural networks, and [PSI] prion may be formed as a by-product of this process.",PMID: 10471702 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Gross chromosomal rearrangements in Saccharomyces cerevisiae replication and recombination defective mutants.,"Chen C, Kolodner RD.","Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Cancer Center and Department of Medicine, University of California-San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, California 92093, USA.","Cancer progression is often associated with the accumulation of gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs), such as translocations, deletion of a chromosome arm, interstitial deletions or inversions. In many instances, GCRs inactivate tumour-suppressor genes or generate novel fusion proteins that initiate carcinogenesis. The mechanism underlying GCR formation appears to involve interactions between DNA sequences of little or no homology. We previously demonstrated that mutations in the gene encoding the largest subunit of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae single-stranded DNA binding protein (RFA1) increase microhomology-mediated GCR formation. To further our understanding of GCR formation, we have developed a novel mutator assay in S. cerevisiae that allows specific detection of such events. In this assay, the rate of GCR formation was increased 600-5, 000-fold by mutations in RFA1, RAD27, MRE11, XRS2 and RAD50, but was minimally affected by mutations in RAD51, RAD54, RAD57, YKU70, YKU80, LIG4 and POL30. Genetic analysis of these mutants suggested that at least three distinct pathways can suppress GCRs: two that suppress microhomology-mediated GCRs (RFA1 and RAD27) and one that suppresses non-homology-mediated GCRs (RAD50/MRE11/XRS2).",PMID: 10471504 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Helical interactions and membrane disposition of the 16-kDa proteolipid subunit of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase analyzed by cysteine replacement mutagenesis.,"Harrison MA, Murray J, Powell B, Kim YI, Finbow ME, Findlay JB.","School of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, United Kingdom. m.a.harrison@leeds.ac.uk","Theoretical mechanisms of proton translocation by the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase require that a transmembrane acidic residue of the multicopy 16-kDa proteolipid subunit be exposed at the exterior surface of the membrane sector of the enzyme, contacting the lipid phase. However, structural support for this theoretical mechanism is lacking. To address this, we have used cysteine mutagenesis to produce a molecular model of the 16-kDa proteolipid complex. Transmembrane helical contacts were determined using oxidative cysteine cross-linking, and accessibility of cysteines to the lipid phase was determined by their reactivity to the lipid-soluble probe N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide. A single model for organization of the four helices of each monomeric proteolipid was the best fit to the experimental data, with helix 1 lining a central pore and helix 2 and helix 3 immediately external to it and forming the principal intermolecular contacts. Helix 4, containing the crucial acidic residue, is peripheral to the complex. The model is consistent not only with theoretical proton transport mechanisms, but has structural similarity to the dodecameric ring complex formed by the related 8-kDa proteolipid of the F(1)F(0)-ATPase. This suggests some commonality between the proton translocating mechanisms of the vacuolar and F(1)F(0)-ATPases.",PMID: 10464277 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
The S. pombe zfs1 gene is required to prevent septation if mitotic progression is inhibited.,"Beltraminelli N, Murone M, Simanis V.","Cell Cycle Control Laboratory, ISREC, Chemin des Boveresses, 1066 Epalinges, Switzerland.","Schizosaccharomyces pombe cdc16p is required to limit the cell to forming a single division septum per cell cycle; the heat-sensitive loss-of-function mutant cdc16-116 completes mitosis, and then undergoes multiple rounds of septum formation without cell cleavage. cdc16p is a homologue of Saccharomyces cerevisiae BUB2p, and has also been implicated in the spindle assembly checkpoint function in S. pombe. To identify other proteins involved in regulating septum formation, we have screened for multicopy suppressors of the cdc16-116 mutation. In this paper, we describe one of these suppressors, zfs1. The null allele (zfs1-D1) is viable. However, at low temperatures it divides at a reduced size, while at higher temperatures, it partially suppresses heat sensitive mutants in genes signalling the onset of septum formation. Zfs1-D1 cells show an increased rate of chromosome loss during exponential growth. Moreover, if assembly of the spindle is prevented, zfs1-D1 cells do not arrest normally, but the activity of cdc2p kinase decays, and cells form a division septum without completing a normal mitosis. We conclude that zfs1 function is required to prevent septum formation and exit from mitosis if the mitotic spindle is not assembled. The suppression of cdc16-116 by zfs1 is independent of dma1 function and the spindle assembly checkpoint genes mad2 and mph1. The genetic interactions of zfs1 with genes regulating septum formation suggest that it may be a modulator of the signal transduction network controlling the onset of septum formation and exit from mitosis.",PMID: 10462526 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

TRX and ASH1 are localized on chromosomes and share several homologous domains with other chromatin-associated proteins, including a highly conserved SET domain and PHD fingers. Based on genetic interactions between trx and ash1 and our previous observation that association of the TRX protein with polytene chromosomes is ash1 dependent, we investigated the possibility of a physical linkage between the two proteins. We found that the endogenous TRX and ASH1 proteins coimmunoprecipitate from embryonic extracts and colocalize on salivary gland polytene chromosomes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that TRX and ASH1 bind in vivo to a relatively small (4 kb) bxd subregion of the homeotic gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx), which contains several trx response elements. Analysis of the effects of ash1 mutations on the activity of this regulatory region indicates that it also contains ash1 response element(s). This suggests that ASH1 and TRX act on Ubx in relatively close proximity to each other. Finally, TRX and ASH1 appear to interact directly through their conserved SET domains, based on binding assays in vitro and in yeast and on coimmunoprecipitation assays with embryo extracts. Collectively, these results suggest that TRX and ASH1 are components that interact either within trxG protein complexes or between complexes that act in close proximity on regulatory DNA to maintain Ubx transcription.",PMID: 10454589 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
"The yeast trimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein alpha subunit, Gpa2p, controls the meiosis-specific kinase Ime2p activity in response to nutrients.","Donzeau M, Bandlow W.","Institut fur Genetik und Mikrobiologie, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen, D-80638 Munich, Germany.","Saccharomyces cerevisiae Gpa2p, the alpha subunit of a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein), is involved in the regulation of vegetative growth and pseudohyphal development. Here we report that Gpa2p also controls sporulation by interacting with the regulatory domain of Ime2p (Sme1p), a protein kinase essential for entrance of meiosis and sporulation. Protein-protein interactions between Gpa2p and Ime2p depend on the GTP-bound state of Gpa2p and correlate with down-regulation of Ime2p kinase activity in vitro. Overexpression of Ime2p inhibits pseudohyphal development and enables diploid cells to sporulate even in the presence of glucose or nitrogen. In contrast, overexpression of Gpa2p in cells simultaneously overproducing Ime2p results in a drastic reduction of sporulation efficiency, demonstrating an inhibitory effect of Gpa2p on Ime2p function. Furthermore, deletion of GPA2 accelerates sporulation on low-nitrogen medium. These observations are consistent with the following model. In glucose-containing medium, diploid cells do not sporulate because Ime2p is inactive or expressed at low levels. Upon starvation, expression of Gpa2p and Ime2p is induced but sporulation is prevented as long as nitrogen is present in the medium. The negative control of Ime2p kinase activity is exerted at least in part through the activated form of Gpa2p and is released as soon as nutrients are exhausted. This model attributes a switch function to Gpa2p in the meiosis-pseudohyphal growth decision.",PMID: 10454558 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

Strains with a mutation of TEL1, a homolog of the human gene (ATM) mutated in patients with ataxia telangiectasia, have short but stable telomeric repeats. Mutations of TLC1 (encoding the RNA subunit of telomerase) result in strains that have continually shortening telomeres and a gradual loss of cell viability; survivors of senescence arise as a consequence of a Rad52p-dependent recombination events that amplify telomeric and subtelomeric repeats. We show that a mutation in MEC1 (a gene related in sequence to TEL1 and ATM) reduces telomere length and that tel1 mec1 double mutant strains have a senescent phenotype similar to that found in tlc1 strains. As observed in tlc1 strains, survivors of senescence in the tel1 mec1 strains occur by a Rad52p-dependent amplification of telomeric and subtelomeric repeats. In addition, we find that strains with both tel1 and tlc1 mutations have a delayed loss of cell viability compared to strains with the single tlc1 mutation. This result argues that the role of Tel1p in telomere maintenance is not solely a direct activation of telomerase.",PMID: 10454554 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Yeast aspartyl-tRNA synthetase residues interacting with tRNA(Asp) identity bases connectively contribute to tRNA(Asp) binding in the ground and transition-state complex and discriminate against non-cognate tRNAs.,"Eriani G, Gangloff J.","UPR 9002 SMBMR du CNRS, Institut de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, 15, rue Rene Descartes, Strasbourg, 67084, France.","Crystallographic studies of the aspartyl-tRNA synthetase-tRNA(Asp)complex from yeast identified on the enzyme a number of residues potentially able to interact with tRNA(Asp). Alanine replacement of these residues (thought to disrupt the interactions) was used in the present study to evaluate their importance in tRNA(Asp)recognition and acylation. The results showed that contacts with the acceptor A of tRNA(Asp)by amino acid residues interacting through their side-chain occur only in the acylation transition state, whereas those located near the G73 discriminator base occur also during initial binding of tRNA(Asp). Interactions with the anticodon bases provide the largest free energy contribution to stability of the enzyme-tRNA complex in its ground state. These contacts also favour catalysis, by acting connectively with each other and with those of G73, as shown by multiple mutant analysis. This implies structural communication transmitting the anticodon recognition signal to the distally located acylation site. This signal might be conveyed via tRNA(Asp)as suggested by the observed conformational change of this molecule upon interaction with AspRS. From binding free energy values corresponding to the different AspRS-tRNA(Asp)interaction domains, it might be concluded that upon complex formation, the anticodon interacts first. Finally, acylation efficiencies of AspRS mutants in the presence of pure tRNA(Asp)and non-fractionated tRNAs indicate that residues involved in the binding of identity bases also discriminate against non-cognate tRNAs.

The number of live cells in the cultures was determined by colony counts on agar plates. Untreated control cells had doubled in number about once at the end of the first week and had gone through eight doublings by the end of the second week. Addition of either 8-bromo-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (8-bromo-cGMP) or human recombinant insulin, made the cells go through 12 and 10 doublings, respectively, by the end of the first week. In contrast, 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (8-bromo-cAMP) had only slight stimulating effects on cell multiplication, but if it was combined with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) the cells went through about 12 doublings during the first week. Addition of LY 83583, an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, prevented cell proliferation. Further addition of 8-bromo-cGMP bypassed this inhibition. Singly, bradykinin or PMA did not affect cell multiplication. However, when these two compounds were combined, the cells went through about 10 doublings during the first week. Neither bradykinin, nor PMA had any releasing effect on the inhibition of LY 83583.

The great influence of the latter interactions is demonstrated for the enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase from yeast (PGK). In the native state, PGK is a compact, bilobal molecule; 35% and 13% of its amino acids are organised in the form of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, respectively. The molecules unfold at acidic pH and low ionic strength forming random-walk structures with a persistence length of 3 nm. More than 90% of the amino acid residues of the ensemble have phi,psi-angles corresponding to those of a straight beta-chain. Upon addition of 50% (v/v) trifluoroethanol to the acid-unfolded protein, the entire molecule is transformed into a rod-like, flexible alpha-helix. Addition of anions, such as chloride or trichloroacetate, to the acid-unfolded protein leads to the formation of amyloid-like fibres over a period of many hours when the anion concentration exceeds a critical limit. Half of the amino acid residues are then organised in beta-sheets. Both of the non-natively folded states of PGK contain more regular secondary structure than the native one. The misfolding starts in both cases from the acid-unfolded state, in which the molecules are essentially more expanded than in other denatured states, e.g. those effected by temperature or guanidine hydrochloride.

The role of the amino-terminal beta-barrel domain of the alpha and beta subunits in the yeast F1-ATPase.,"Yao B, Mueller DM.","Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Chicago Medical School, Illinois 60064, USA.","The crystal structure of mitochondrial F1-ATPase indicates that the alpha and beta subunits fold into a structure defined by three domains: the top beta-barrel domain, the middle nucleotide-binding domain, and the C-terminal alpha-helix bundle domain (Abrahams et al., 1994); Bianchet et al., 1998). The beta-barrel domains of the alpha and beta subunits form a crown structure at the top of F1, which was suggested to stabilize it (Abrahams et al. 1994). In this study, the role of the beta-barrel domain in the alpha and beta subunits of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae F1, with regard to its folding and assembly, was investigated. The beta-barrel domains of yeast F1alpha and beta subunits were expressed individually and together in Escherichia coli. When expressed separately, the beta-barrel domain of the beta subunit formed a large aggregate structure, while the domain of the alpha subunit was predominately a monomer or dimer. However, coexpression of the beta-barrel domain of alpha subunit with the beta-barrel domain of beta subunit, greatly reduced the aggregation of the beta subunit domain. Furthermore, the two domains copurified in complexes with the major portion of the complex found in a small molecular weight form. These results indicate that the beta-barrel domain of the alpha and beta subunits interact specifically with each other and that these interactions prevent the aggregation of the beta-barrel domain of the beta subunit. These results mimic in vivo results and suggest that the interactions of the beta-barrel domains may be critical during the folding and assembly of F1.",PMID: 10449236 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Characterization of the role played by the RAD59 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in ectopic recombination.,"Jablonovich Z, Liefshitz B, Steinlauf R, Kupiec M.","Department of Molecular Microbiology and Biotechnology,","The RAD52 group of genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae controls the repair of DNA damage by a recombinational mechanism.

In the present study we have examined the role played by the Rad59 protein in mitotic ectopic recombination and analyzed the genetic interactions with other members of the repair group. We found that Rad59p plays a role in ectopic gene conversion that depends on the presence of Rad52p but is independent of the function of the RecA homologue Rad51p and of the Rad57 protein. The RAD59 gene product also participates in the RAD1-dependent pathway of recombination between direct repeats.

Half of Saccharomyces cerevisiae carbamoyl phosphate synthetase produces and channels carbamoyl phosphate to the fused aspartate transcarbamoylase domain.,"Serre V, Guy H, Penverne B, Lux M, Rotgeri A, Evans D, Herve G.","Laboratoire de Biochimie des Signaux Regulateurs Cellulaires et Moleculaires, UMR 7631 CNRS-Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, 96 Bd Raspail 75006 Paris, France.","The first two steps of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are catalyzed by a 240-kDa bifunctional protein encoded by the ura2 locus. Although the constituent enzymes, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPSase) and aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) function independently, there are interdomain interactions uniquely associated with the multifunctional protein. Both CPSase and ATCase are feedback inhibited by UTP. Moreover, the intermediate carbamoyl phosphate is channeled from the CPSase domain where it is synthesized to the ATCase domain where it is used in the synthesis of carbamoyl aspartate. To better understand these processes, a recombinant plasmid was constructed that encoded a protein lacking the amidotransferase domain and the amino half of the CPSase domain, a 100-kDa chain segment. The truncated complex consisted of the carboxyl half of the CPSase domain fused to the ATCase domain via the pDHO domain, an inactive dihydroorotase homologue that bridges the two functional domains in the native molecule. Not only was the ""half CPSase"" catalytically active, but it was regulated by UTP to the same extent as the parent molecule. In contrast, the ATCase domain was no longer sensitive to the nucleotide, suggesting that the two catalytic activities are controlled by distinct mechanisms. Most remarkably, isotope dilution and transient time measurements showed that the truncated complex channels carbamoyl phosphate. The overall CPSase-ATCase reaction is much less sensitive than the parent molecule to the ATCase bisubstrate analogue, N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA), providing evidence that the endogenously produced carbamoyl phosphate is sequestered and channeled to the ATCase active site.",PMID: 10446140 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

It is found that the endogenous substrate, lanosterol, can readily occupy the putative active site of the CYP51 model such that the known mono-oxygenation reaction, leading to C14-demethylation of lanosterol, is the preferred route of metabolism for this particular substrate. Key amino acid contacts within the CYP51 active site appear to orientate lanosterol for oxidative attack at the C14-methyl group, and the position of the substrate relative to the haem moiety is consistent with the phenyl-iron complexation studies reported by Tuck et al. [J. Biol. Chem., 267, 13175-13179 (1992)]. Typical azole inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, are able to fit the putative active site of CYP51 by a combination of haem ligation, hydrogen bonding, pi-pi stacking and hydrophobic interactions within the enzyme's haem environment. The mode of action of azole antifungals, as described by the modelling studies, is supported by quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analyses on two groups of structurally related fungal inhibitors. Moreover, the results of molecular electrostatic isopotential (EIP) energy calculations are compatible with the proposed mode of binding between azole antifungal agents and the putative active site of CYP51, although membrane interactions may also have a role in the antifungal activity of azole derivatives.",PMID: 10445042 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Functional interactions of Prp8 with both splice sites at the spliceosomal catalytic center.,"Siatecka M, Reyes JL, Konarska MM.","The Rockefeller University, New York, New York 10021, USA.","A U5 snRNP protein, hPrp8, interacts closely with the GU dinucleotide at the 5' splice site (5'SS), forming a specific UV-inducible cross-link. To test if this physical contact between the 5'SS and the carboxy-terminal region of Prp8 reflects a functional recognition of the 5'SS during spliceosome assembly, we mutagenized the corresponding region of yeast Prp8 and screened the resulting mutants for suppression of 5'SS mutations in vivo. All of the isolated prp8 alleles not only suppress 5'SS but also 3'SS mutations, affecting the second catalytic step. Suppression of the 5'SS mutations by prp8 alleles was also tested in the presence of U1-7U snRNA, a predicted suppressor of the U+2A mutation. As expected, U1-7U efficiently suppresses prespliceosome formation, and the first, but not the second, step of U+2A pre-mRNA splicing. Independently, Prp8 functionally interacts with both splice sites at the later stage of splicing, affecting the efficiency of the second catalytic step. The striking proximity of two of the prp8 suppressor mutations to the site of the 5'SS:hPrp8 cross-link suggests that some protein:5'SS contacts made before the first step may be subsequently extended to accommodate the 3'SS for the second catalytic step.

The prp8 mutants also suppress mutations in position A51 of the critical ACAGAG motif in U6 snRNA, which has been observed previously to cross-link position 2 of the 5' GU. Other mutations in the 5' splice site, branchpoint, and neighboring residues of the U6 ACAGAG motif are not suppressed. Notably, the suppressed residues are specifically conserved from yeast to man, and from U2- to U12-dependent spliceosomes. We propose that Prp8 participates in a previously unrecognized tertiary interaction between U6 snRNA and both the 5' and 3' ends of the intron.

"Enhancer of split [E(spl)(D)] is a gro-independent, hypermorphic mutation in Drosophila.","Nagel AC, Yu Y, Preiss A.","Universitat Hohenheim, Institut fur Genetik, Stuttgart, Germany.","Enhancer of split [E(spl)] refers to a gene complex in Drosophila melanogaster, which contains a number of target genes of the Notch signaling pathway. The complex was originally identified by a dominant mutation E(spl)(D) that displays allele-specific interactions with a recessive mutation in the Notch locus called split (N(spl)). The spl phenotype is characterized by smaller eyes with irregularly spaced ommatidia, and it is strongly enhanced by E(spl)(D). This enhancement is correlated with a truncation of one of the E(spl) bHLH genes, m8, causing an increased stability of the mutant transcripts and an altered C-terminus in the mutant M8* protein. Concurrently, an insertion of a middle repetitive element in the adjacent groucho (gro) gene was observed. In this work, three different E(spl)(D) revertants (BE22, BE25, BX37), which have lost the ability to enhance N(spl) completely, were analyzed at the molecular level. In each case, the structure of the mutant M8* protein was affected, suggesting a specific involvement of the aberrant protein in the enhancement of the spl phenotype. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that a perfect phenocopy of spl enhancement can be achieved with hybrid constructs, where the altered C-terminus of M8* was fused to other E(spl) bHLH proteins. Thus, the ability to interact with N(spl) is not restricted to M8* but instead can be induced by an appropriate mutation in other E(spl) bHLH genes within the context of N(spl). In a N(spl) background, E(spl)(D) behaves like a hyperactive M8 mutation. However, the mutant M8* protein has lost the ability of binding to the corepressor Gro, which is an essential feature for normal E(spl) activity. Yet, other protein interactions, notably those with other bHLH proteins of either E(spl) or proneural family, are still observed. These findings suggest that the structural changes associated with the E(spl)(D) mutant protein are the primary cause for the phenotypic interactions with the recessive Notch mutation N(spl).

Long-distance rotational echo double resonance measurements for the determination of secondary structure and conformational heterogeneity in peptides.,"Arshava B, Breslav M, Antohi O, Stark RE, Garbow JR, Becker JM, Naider F.","Department of Chemistry, College of Staten Island and the Graduate School of the City University of New York, 10314, USA.","The utility of rotational echo double resonance (REDOR) NMR spectroscopy for determining the conformations of linear peptides has been examined critically using a series of crystalline and amorphous samples. The focus of the present work was the evaluation of long-distance (> 5 A) interactions using 13C-15N dephasing. Detailed studies of specifically labeled melanostatin and synthetic analogs of the alpha-factor yeast mating hormone show that nitrogen-dephased, carbon-observe REDOR measurements are reliable for distances up to 6.0 A, and that dipolar interactions can be detected for distances up to 7 A. By contrast, nitrogen-observe REDOR gives reliable results only for distances shorter than 5.0 A. To measure distances accurately, REDOR data must be corrected for the effects of natural-abundance spins. These corrections are particularly important for measuring long distances, which are of the greatest value for determining peptide secondary structure. We have developed a spherical shell model for calculating the effect of these background spins. The REDOR studies also indicate that in a lyophilized powder, the tridecapeptide alpha-factor mating pheromone from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (WHWLQLKPGQPMY) probably exists as a distribution of different turn structures around the KPGQ region. This finding revises previous solid-state NMR studies on this peptide, which concluded alpha-factor assumes a distorted type-I beta-turn in the Pro-Gly central region of the molecule [J.R. Garbow, M.

Multiple sex pheromones and receptors of a mushroom-producing fungus elicit mating in yeast.,"Fowler TJ, DeSimone SM, Mitton MF, Kurjan J, Raper CA.","Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont 05405, USA.","The mushroom-producing fungus Schizophyllum commune has thousands of mating types defined, in part, by numerous lipopeptide pheromones and their G protein-linked receptors. Compatible combinations of pheromones and receptors encoded by different mating types regulate a pathway of sexual development leading to mushroom formation and meiosis. A complex set of pheromone-receptor interactions maximizes the likelihood of outbreeding; for example, a single pheromone can activate more than one receptor and a single receptor can be activated by more than one pheromone. The current study demonstrates that the sex pheromones and receptors of Schizophyllum, when expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, can substitute for endogenous pheromone and receptor and induce the yeast pheromone response pathway through the yeast G protein. Secretion of active Schizophyllum pheromone requires some, but not all, of the biosynthetic machinery used by the yeast lipopeptide pheromone a-factor. The specificity of interaction among pheromone-receptor pairs in Schizophyllum was reproduced in yeast, thus providing a powerful system for exploring molecular aspects of pheromone-receptor interactions for a class of seven-transmembrane-domain receptors common to a wide range of organisms.",PMID: 10436012 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Role of glutamate 91 in information transfer during substrate activation of yeast pyruvate decarboxylase.,"Li H, Furey W, Jordan F.","Department of Chemistry and Biological Sciences and Program in Cellular and Molecular Biodynamics, Rutgers, the State University, Newark, New Jersey 07102, USA.","Oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis was carried out on pyruvate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.1) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae at E91, located on the putative substrate activation pathway and linking the alpha and gamma domains of the enzyme. While C221 on the beta domain is the residue at which substrate activation is triggered [Baburina, I., et al. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 5630-5635; Baburina, I., et al.

Substitution at E91 with Q, D, or A led to modest reductions in the specific activity (4-, 5-, and 30-fold), as well as in both the turnover number and the catalytic efficiency, in that order. Interestingly, the Hill coefficient was only slightly reduced for the E91D variant, but cooperativity was virtually abolished for the E91Q and E91A variants. The thermal stability of the variants was reduced in the following order: wild type > E91Q > E91D > E91A; circular dichroism and fluorescence experiments also demonstrated that the tertiary structure of the enzyme was affected by these substitutions. The variants could be purified as apoenzymes, demonstrating their impaired ability to bind thiamin diphosphate. Apparently, the charge at residue 91 is quite important for maintaining optimal cooperativity. To maintain strong domain-domain interactions, the length of the side chain at position 91 with hydrogen bonding potential to W412 is sufficient.",PMID: 10433706 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Production in vitro by the cytochrome P450 CYP94A1 of major C18 cutin monomers and potential messengers in plant-pathogen interactions: enantioselectivity studies.,"Pinot F, Benveniste I, Salaun JP, Loreau O, Noel JP, Schreiber L, Durst F.","Institut de Biologie Moleculaire des Plantes-CNRS UPR406, Departement d'Enzymologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, 28 rue Goethe, F-67083 Strasbourg Cedex, France. franck.pinot@bota-ulp.u-strasbg.fr","The major C(18) cutin monomers are 18-hydroxy-9,10-epoxystearic and 9,10,18-trihydroxystearic acids. These compounds are also known messengers in plant-pathogen interactions. We have previously shown that their common precursor 9,10-epoxystearic acid was formed by the epoxidation of oleic acid in Vicia sativa microsomes (Pinot, Salaun, Bosch, Lesot, Mioskowski and Durst (1992) Biochem.

The reactions were not catalysed by microsomes from yeast transformed with a void plasmid or in absence of NADPH. After incubation of a synthetic racemic mixture of 9,10-epoxystearic acid with microsomes of yeast expressing CYP94A1, the chirality of the residual epoxide was shifted to 66:34 in favour of the (9S,10R) enantiomer. Both enantiomers were incubated separately and V(max)/K(m) values of 16 and 3.42 ml/min per nmol of P450 for (9R, 10S) and (9S,10R) respectively were determined, demonstrating that CYP94A1 is enantioselective for the (9R,10S) enantiomer, which is preferentially formed in V. sativa microsomes. Compared with the epoxide, the diol 9,10-dihydroxystearic acid was a much poorer substrate for the omega-hydroxylase, with a measured V(max)/K(m) of 0.33 ml/min per nmol of P450.

Binding of elongin A or a von Hippel-Lindau peptide stabilizes the structure of yeast elongin C.,"Botuyan MV, Koth CM, Mer G, Chakrabartty A, Conaway JW, Conaway RC, Edwards AM, Arrowsmith CH, Chazin WJ.","Division of Molecular and Structural Biology, Ontario Cancer Institute and Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, 610 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, Canada M5G 2M9.","Elongin is a heterotrimeric transcription elongation factor composed of subunits A, B, and C in mammals. Elongin A and C are F-box-containing and SKP1 homologue proteins, respectively, and are therefore of interest for their potential roles in cell cycle-dependent proteolysis. Mammalian elongin C interacts with both elongin A and elongin B, as well as with the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein VHL. To investigate the corresponding interactions in yeast, we have utilized NMR spectroscopy combined with ultracentrifugal sedimentation experiments to examine complexes of yeast elongin C (Elc1) with yeast elongin A (Ela1) and two peptides from homologous regions of Ela1 and human VHL. Elc1 alone is a homotetramer composed of subunits with a structured N-terminal region and a dynamically unstable C-terminal region. Binding of a peptide fragment of the Elc1-interaction domain of Ela1 or with a homologous peptide from VHL promotes folding of the C-terminal region of Elc1 into two regular helical structures and dissociates Elc1 into homodimers. Moreover, analysis of the complex of Elc1 with the full Elc1-interaction domain of Ela1 reveals that the Elc1 homodimer is dissociated to preferentially form an Ela1/Elc1 heterodimer. Thus, elongin C is found to oligomerize in solution and to undergo significant structural rearrangements upon binding of two different partner proteins. These results suggest a structural basis for the interaction of an F-box-containing protein with a SKP1 homologue and the modulation of this interaction by the tumor suppressor VHL.",PMID: 10430890 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

It functions as a membrane anchor for the ATP-driven protein import motor whose other subunits are the mitochondrial 70-kDa heat-shock protein (mhsp70) and its nucleotide exchange factor, mGrpE. To understand how this motor is anchored to the inner membrane, we have overexpressed Tim44 in Escherichia coli and studied the properties of the pure protein and its interaction with model lipid membranes. Limited proteolysis and analytical ultracentrifugation indicate that Tim44 is an elongated monomer with a stably folded C-terminal domain. The protein binds strongly to liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine and cardiolipin but only weakly to liposomes containing phosphatidylcholine alone.

Genetic interactions in yeast between Ypt GTPases and Arf guanine nucleotide exchangers.,"Jones S, Jedd G, Kahn RA, Franzusoff A, Bartolini F, Segev N.","Department of Pharmacological and Physiological Sciences, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA.","Two families of GTPases, Arfs and Ypt/rabs, are key regulators of vesicular transport. While Arf proteins are implicated in vesicle budding from the donor compartment, Ypt/rab proteins are involved in the targeting of vesicles to the acceptor compartment. Recently, we have shown a role for Ypt31/32p in exit from the yeast trans-Golgi, suggesting a possible function for Ypt/rab proteins in vesicle budding as well. Here we report the identification of a new member of the Sec7-domain family, SYT1, as a high-copy suppressor of a ypt31/32 mutation. Several proteins that belong to the Sec7-domain family, including the yeast Gea1p, have recently been shown to stimulate nucleotide exchange by Arf GTPases. Nucleotide exchange by Arf GTPases, the switch from the GDP- to the GTP-bound form, is thought to be crucial for their function. Sec7p itself has an important role in the yeast secretory pathway. However, its mechanism of action is not yet understood. We show that all members of the Sec7-domain family exhibit distinct genetic interactions with the YPT genes. Biochemical assays demonstrate that, although the homology between the members of the Sec7-domain family is relatively low (20-35%) and limited to a small domain, they all can act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Arf proteins, but not for Ypt GTPases. The Sec7-domain of Sec7p is sufficient for this activity. Interestingly, the Sec7 domain activity is inhibited by brefeldin A (BFA), a fungal metabolite that inhibits some of the Arf-GEFs, indicating that this domain is a target for BFA. These results demonstrate that the ability to act as Arf-GEFs is a general property of all Sec7-domain proteins in yeast. The genetic interactions observed between Arf GEFs and Ypt GTPases suggest the existence of a Ypt-Arf GTPase cascade in the secretory pathway.",PMID: 10430582 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

As the subunit VIa-null strain possesses a fully active and assembled cytochrome oxidase, multiple ATP-regulating sites were characterized with respect to their location and their kinetic effect: (a) intra-mitochondrial ATP inhibited the complex IV activity of the null strain, whereas the prevailing effect of ATP on the wild-type strain, at low ionic strength, was activation on the cytosolic side of complex IV, mediated by subunit VIa. However, at physiological ionic strength (i.e. approximately 200 mM), activation by ATP was absent but inhibition was not impaired; (b) in ethanol-respiring mitochondria, when the electron flux was modulated using a protonophoric uncoupler, the redox state of aa3 cytochromes varied with respect to activation (wild-type) or inhibition (null-mutant) of the cytochrome oxidase by ATP; (c) consequently, the control coefficient of cytochrome oxidase on respiratory flux, decreased (wild-type) or increased (null-mutant) in the presence of ATP; (d) considering electron transport from cytochrome c to oxygen, the response of cytochrome oxidase to its thermodynamic driving force was increased by ATP for the wild-type but not for the mutant subunit. Taken together, these findings indicate that at physiological concentration, ATP regulates yeast cytochrome oxidase via subunit-mediated interactions on both sides of the inner membrane, thus subtly tuning the thermodynamic and kinetic control of respiration. This study opens up new prospects for understanding the feedback regulation of the respiratory chain by ATP.",PMID: 10429195 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

Recent data suggest that the plant SNF1-related kinases (SnRK1 family) are key enzymes implicated in the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammals, the SNF1 and AMPKalpha protein kinases interact with two other families of proteins, namely SNF4/AMPKgamma and SIP1/SIP2/GAL83/AMPKbeta, to form active heterotrimeric complexes. In this paper, we describe the characterisation of three novel cDNAs. AKINbeta1 and AKINbeta2 encode proteins similar to SIP1, SIP2 and GAL83 and AKINgamma codes for a protein showing similarity with SNF4. Using the two-hybrid system, specific interactions have been shown between A. thaliana AKINbeta1/beta2, AKINgamma and AKINgamma as well as between the A. thaliana and S. cerevisiae subunits. Interestingly, AKINbeta1, AKINbeta2 and AKINgamma mRNAs accumulate differentially in A. thaliana tissues and are modulated during development and under different growth conditions. These data suggest the presence in higher plants of a conserved heterotrimeric complex. Moreover, the differential transcription of different non-catalytic subunits can constitute a first level of regulation of the SNF1-like complex in plants.",PMID: 10417704 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Ubiquitin binding interface mapping on yeast ubiquitin hydrolase by NMR chemical shift perturbation.,"Rajesh S, Sakamoto T, Iwamoto-Sugai M, Shibata T, Kohno T, Ito Y.","Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), Saitama, Japan.","The interaction between the 26 kDa yeast ubiquitin hydrolase (YUH1), involved in maintaining the monomeric ubiquitin pool in cells, and the 8.5 kDa yeast ubiquitin protein has been studied by heteronuclear multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. Chemical shift perturbation of backbone (1)H(N), (15)N, and (13)C(alpha) resonances of YUH1, in a YUH1-ubiquitin mixture and in a 35 kDa covalent complex with ubiquitin (a stable analogue of the tetrahedral reaction intermediate), was employed to identify the ubiquitin binding interface of YUH1. This interface mapped on the secondary structure of YUH1 suggests a wide area of contact for ubiquitin, encompassing the N-terminus, alpha1, alpha4, beta2, beta3, and beta6, coincident with the high specificity of YUH1 for ubiquitin. The presence of several hydrophobic clusters in the ubiquitin binding interface of YUH1 suggests that hydrophobic interactions are equally important as ionic interactions in contacting ubiquitin. The residues in the binding interface exhibit a high percentage of homology among the members of the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase family, indicating the well-conserved nature of the ubiquitin binding interface reported in this study. The secondary structure of YUH1, from our NMR studies, was similar to the recently determined structure of its human homologue ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L3 (UCH-L3), except for the absence of the helix H3 of UCH-L3. This region in YUH1 (helix H3 of UCH-L3) was least perturbed upon ubiquitin binding. Therefore, the binding interface was mapped onto the corresponding residues in the UCH-L3 crystal structure. A model for ubiquitin binding to YUH1 is proposed, in which a good correlation was observed for the lateral binding of ubiquitin to UCH-L3 (YUH1), stabilized by the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions.",PMID: 10413498 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Glutamic acid 472 and lysine 480 of the sodium pump alpha 1 subunit are essential for activity. Their conservation in pyrophosphatases suggests their involvement in recognition of ATP phosphates.,"Scheiner-Bobis G, Schreiber S.","Institut fur Biochemie und Endokrinologie, Fachbereich Veterinarmedizin, Justus-Liebig-Universitat Giessen, Germany. Georgios.Scheiner-Bobis@vetmed.uni-giessen.de","P-type ATPases such as the Na+,K+-ATPase (sodium pump) hydrolyze ATP to pump ions through biological membranes against their electrochemical gradients. The mechanisms that couple ATP hydrolysis to the vectorial ion transport are not yet understood, but unveiling structures that participate in ATP binding and in the formation of the ionophore might help to gain insight into this process. Looking at the alpha- and beta-phosphates of ATP as a pyrophosphate molecule, we found that peptides highly conserved among all soluble inorganic pyrophosphatases are also present in ion-transporting ATPases. Included therein are Glu48 and Lys56 of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae pyrophosphatase (SCE1-PPase) that are essential for the activity of this enzyme and have been shown in crystallographic analysis to interact with phosphate molecules. To test the hypothesis that equivalent amino acids are also essential for the activity of ion-transporting ATPases, Glu472 and Lys480 of the sodium pump alpha 1 subunit corresponding to Glu48 and Lys56 of SCE1-PPase were mutated to various amino acids. Mutants of the sodium pump alpha1 subunit were expressed in yeast and analyzed for their ATPase activity and their ability to bind ouabain in the presence of either ATP, Mg2+, and Na+ or phosphate and Mg2+. All four mutants investigated, Glu472Ala, Glu472Asp, Lys480Ala, and Lys480Arg, display only a fraction of the ATPase activity obtained with the wild-type enzyme. The same applies with respect to their ability to bind ouabain, where maximum ouabain binding to the mutants accounts for only about 10% of the binding obtained with the wild-type enzyme. On the basis of our results, we conclude that Glu472 and Lys480 are essential for the activity of the sodium pump. Their function is probably to arrest the alpha- and beta-phosphate groups of ATP in a proper position prior to hydrolysis of the gamma-phosphate group. The identification of these amino acids as essential components of the ATP-recognizing mechanism of the pump has resulted in a testable hypothesis for the initial interactions of the sodium pump, and possibly of other P-type ATPases, with ATP.",PMID: 10413494 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

A Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein, identical to Tid3p/Ndc80p and here designated scHec1p, has similarities in structure and biological function to hsHec1p. Budding yeast cells deleted in the scHEC1/NDC80 allele are not viable, but this lethal phenotype can be rescued by hsHEC1 under control of the endogenous scHEC1 promoter. At the nonpermissive temperature, significant mitotic delay, chromosomal missegregation, and decreased viability were observed in yeast cells with temperature-sensitive (ts) alleles of hsHEC1. In the hshec1-113 ts mutant, we found a single-point mutation changing Trp395 to a stop codon, which resulted in the expression of a C-terminally truncated 45-kDa protein. The binding of this mutated protein, hshec1-113p, to five identified hsHec1p-associated proteins was unchanged, while its binding to human SMC1 protein and yeast Smc1p was ts. Hec1p also interacts with Smc2p, and the binding of the mutated hshec1-113p to Smc2p was not ts. Overexpression of either hsHEC1 or scHEC1 suppressed the lethal phenotype of smc1-2 and smc2-6 at nonpermissive temperatures, suggesting that the interactions between Hec1p and Smc1p and -2p are biologically significant.

Chromatin opening and transactivator potentiation by RAP1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"Yu L, Morse RH.","Molecular Genetics Program, Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health, and State University of New York School of Public Health, Albany, New York 12201-2002, USA.","Transcriptional activators function in vivo via binding sites that may be packaged into chromatin. Here we show that whereas the transcriptional activator GAL4 is strongly able to perturb chromatin structure via a nucleosomal binding site in yeast, GCN4 does so poorly. Correspondingly, GCN4 requires assistance from an accessory protein, RAP1, for activation of the HIS4 promoter, whereas GAL4 does not. The requirement for RAP1 for GCN4-mediated HIS4 activation is dictated by the DNA-binding domain of GCN4 and not the activation domain, suggesting that RAP1 assists GCN4 in gaining access to its binding site. Consistent with this, overexpression of GCN4 partially alleviates the requirement for RAP1, whereas HIS4 activation via a weak GAL4 binding site requires RAP1. RAP1 is extremely effective at interfering with positioning of a nucleosome containing its binding site, consistent with a role in opening chromatin at the HIS4 promoter. Furthermore, increasing the spacing between binding sites for RAP1 and GCN4 by 5 or 10 bp does not impair HIS4 activation, indicating that cooperative protein-protein interactions are not involved in transcriptional facilitation by RAP1. We conclude that an important role of RAP1 is to assist activator binding by opening chromatin.",PMID: 10409719 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

The folding of the eIF4G1 domain was evidenced by the eIF4E-dependent changes in its protease sensitivity and (1)H-(15)N HSQC NMR spectrum. Analysis of a series of charge-to-alanine mutations throughout the essential 55.4-kDa core of yeast eIF4G1 also revealed substitutions within this 98-amino acid region that led to reduced eIF4E binding in vivo and in vitro. These data suggest that the association of yeast eIF4E with eIF4G1 leads to the formation of a structured domain within eIF4G1 that could serve as a specific site for interactions with other components of the translational apparatus.

Repressor binding to a dorsal regulatory site traps human eIF4E in a high cap-affinity state.,"Ptushkina M, von der Haar T, Karim MM, Hughes JM, McCarthy JE.","Posttranscriptional Control Group, Department of Biomolecular Sciences, UMIST, PO Box 88, Manchester M60 1QD, UK.","Eukaryotic translation initiation involves recognition of the 5' end of cellular mRNA by the cap-binding complex known as eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F). Initiation is a key point of regulation in gene expression in response to mechanisms mediated by signal transduction pathways. We have investigated the molecular interactions underlying inhibition of human eIF4E function by regulatable repressors called 4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs). Two essential components of eIF4F are the cap-binding protein eIF4E, and eIF4G, a multi-functional protein that binds both eIF4E and other essential eIFs. We show that the 4E-BPs 1 and 2 block the interaction between eIF4G and eIF4E by competing for binding to a dorsal site on eIF4E. Remarkably, binding of the 4E-BPs at this dorsal site enhances cap-binding via the ventral cap-binding slot, thus trapping eIF4E in inactive complexes with high affinity for capped mRNA. The binding contacts and affinities for the interactions between 4E-BP1/2 and eIF4E are distinct (estimated K(d) values of 10(-8) and 3x10(-9) for 4E-BP1 and 2, respectively), and the differences in these properties are determined by three amino acids within an otherwise conserved motif. These data provide a quantitative framework for a new molecular model of translational regulation.",PMID: 10406811 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Oligomerized Ced-4 kills budding yeast through a caspase-independent mechanism.,"Tao W, Walke DW, Morgan JI.","Department of Developmental Neurobiology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 332 North Lauderdale Street, Memphis, Tennessee, 38105-2794, USA.","In Caenorhabdtis elegans, Ced-3, Ced-4, and Ced-9 are components of a cell suicide program. Ced-4 facilitates the proteolytic activation of the caspase, Ced-3, while Ced-9 opposes Ced-3/Ced-4 killing. To examine the interactions among these proteins they were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ced-3 and Ced-4 were lethal when expressed alone, revealing an intrinsic Ced-4 killing activity. Coexpression of Ced-9 blocked Ced-3- and Ced-4-induced killing, showing Ced-9 can independently antagonize the action of both proteins. Ced-3- but not Ced-4-toxicity was attenuated by coexpression of the caspase inhibitors, CrmA and p35. Thus, besides its Ced-3- and Ced-9-dependent action in C. elegans, Ced-4 has an additional Ced-9-dependent, Ced-3-independent killing mechanism in yeast. Two-hybrid analysis confirmed that Ced-4 formed heteromers with Ced-9. In addition, Ced-4 formed homomers and mutation of its nucleoside triphosphate binding motif eliminated both homomerization and cell killing. We suggest the caspase-independent lethality of Ced-4 in yeast is mediated by a Ced-4 homomer. Copyright 1999 Academic Press.",PMID: 10403845 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
A small region in HMG I(Y) is critical for cooperation with NF-kappaB on DNA.,"Zhang XM, Verdine GL.","Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, USA.","The high mobility group HMG I(Y) protein has been reported to promote the expression of several NF-kappaB-dependent genes by enhancing the binding of NF-kappaB to DNA. The molecular origins of cooperativity in the binding of NF-kappaB and HMG I(Y) to DNA are not well understood. Here we have examined the determinants of specificity in the binding of HMG I(Y), both alone and in cooperation with NF-kappaB, to two different DNA elements, PRDII from the interferon-beta enhancer and IgkappaB from the immunoglobulin kappa light chain enhancer. Of particular interest was the influence of a flanking AT-rich sequence on binding by HMG I(Y). Utilizing yeast one-hybrid screening assays together with alanine-scanning mutagenesis, we have identified mutations of residues in HMG I(Y) that decrease cooperative binding of NF-kappaB to PRDII and IgkappaB sites. These same mutations similarly decreased the binding of HMG I(Y) alone to DNA, and paradoxically, decreased the strength of protein-protein interactions between HMG I(Y) and NF-kappaB. Of the three tandemly repeated basic regions that represent putative DNA-binding motifs in HMG I(Y), the residues within the second repeat are most important for recognition of core NF-kappaB sites, whereas the second and third repeats both appear to be involved in binding to sites that are flanked by AT-rich sequences. Overall, the second repeat of HMG I(Y) is primarily responsible for the stimulatory effect of this protein on the binding of NF-kappaB to PRDII and IgkappaB elements.",PMID: 10400641 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Specific negative effects resulting from elevated levels of the recombinational repair protein Rad54p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"Clever B, Schmuckli-Maurer J, Sigrist M, Glassner BJ, Heyer WD.","Institute for General Microbiology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.","RAD54 is an important gene in the RAD52 group that controls recombinational repair of DNA damage in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Rad54p is a DNA-dependent ATPase and shares seven conserved sequence motifs with proteins of the Swi2p/Snf2p family. Genetic analysis of mutations in motif IA, the putative ATP-binding fold of Rad54p, demonstrated the functional importance of this motif. Overexpression of these mutant proteins resulted in strong, dominant-negative effects on cell survival. High levels of full-length wild-type Rad54p or specific parts of Rad54p also resulted in negative effects, dependent on the ploidy of the host cell. This differential effect was not under a/alpha mating-type control. Deletion of the RAD54 gene led to a small but significant increase in the mutation rate. However, the negative overexpression effects in haploid cells could not be explained by an accumulation of (recessive) lethal mutations. All negative overexpression effects were found to be enhanced under genotoxic stress. We suggest that the negative overexpression effects are the result of unbalanced protein-protein interactions, indicating that Rad54p is involved in multiple interactions, dependent on the physiological situation. Diploid wild-type cells contained an estimated 7000 Rad54p molecules/cell, whereas haploid cells about 3500/cell. Rad54p levels were highest in actively growing cells compared to stationary phase cells. Rad54 protein levels were found to be elevated after DNA damage.

Recruitment of cyclin T1/P-TEFb to an HIV type 1 long terminal repeat promoter proximal RNA target is both necessary and sufficient for full activation of transcription.,"Bieniasz PD, Grdina TA, Bogerd HP, Cullen BR.","Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Genetics, Box 3025, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.","Transcriptional activation of the HIV type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter element by the viral Tat protein is an essential step in the HIV-1 life cycle. Tat function is mediated by the TAR RNA target element encoded within the LTR and is known to require the recruitment of a complex consisting of Tat and the cyclin T1 (CycT1) component of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) to TAR. Here, we demonstrate that both TAR and Tat become entirely dispensable for activation of the HIV-1 LTR promoter when CycT1/P-TEFb is artificially recruited to a heterologous promoter proximal RNA target. The level of activation observed was indistinguishable from the level induced by Tat and was neither inhibited nor increased when Tat was expressed in trans. Activation by artificially recruited CycT1 depended on the ability to bind the CDK9 component of P-TEFb. In contrast, although binding to both Tat and TAR was essential for the ability of CycT1 to act as a Tat cofactor, these interactions became dispensable when CycT1 was directly recruited to the LTR. Importantly, activation of the LTR both by Tat and by directly recruited CycT1 was found to be at the level of transcription elongation. Together, these data demonstrate that recruitment of CycT1/P-TEFb to the HIV-1 LTR is fully sufficient to activate this promoter element and imply that the sole role of the Tat/TAR axis in viral transcription is to permit the recruitment of CycT1/P-TEFb.",PMID: 10393900 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

Adherence to the prokaryotic ""positive-inside"" rule of membrane protein topology.","Rojo EE, Guiard B, Neupert W, Stuart RA.","Institut fur Physiologische Chemie der Universitat Munchen, Goethestrasse 33, 80336 Munchen, Germany.","Export of N-terminal tails of mitochondrial inner membrane proteins from the mitochondrial matrix is a membrane potential-dependent process, mediated by the Oxa1p translocation machinery. The hydrophilic segments of these membrane proteins, which undergo export, display a characteristic charge profile where intermembrane space-localized segments bear a net negative charge, whereas those remaining in the matrix have a net positive one. Using a model protein, preSu9(1-112)-dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which undergoes Oxa1p-mediated N-tail export, we demonstrate here that the net charge of N- and C-flanking regions of the transmembrane domain play a critical role in determining the orientation of the insertion process. The N-tail must bear a net negative charge to be exported to the intermembrane space. Furthermore, a net positive charge of the C-terminal region supports this N-tail export event. These data provide experimental evidence that protein export in mitochondria adheres to the ""positive-inside"" rule, described for sec-independent sorting of membrane proteins in prokaryotes. We propose here that the importance of a charge profile reflects a need for specific protein-protein interactions to occur in the export reaction, presumably at the level of the Oxa1p export machinery.",PMID: 10391898 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
In vivo analysis of the domains of yeast Rvs167p suggests Rvs167p function is mediated through multiple protein interactions.,"Colwill K, Field D, Moore L, Friesen J, Andrews B.","Department of Molecular and Medical Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada.","Morphological changes during cell division in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are controlled by cell-cycle regulators. The Pcl-Pho85p kinase complex has been implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton at least in part through Rvs167p. Rvs167p consists of three domains called BAR, GPA, and SH3. Using a two-hybrid assay, we demonstrated that each region of Rvs167p participates in protein-protein interactions: the BAR domain bound the BAR domain of another Rvs167p protein and that of Rvs161p, the GPA region bound Pcl2p, and the SH3 domain bound Abp1p. We identified Rvs167p as a Las17p/Bee1p-interacting protein in a two-hybrid screen and showed that Las17p/Bee1p bound the SH3 domain of Rvs167p. We tested the extent to which the Rvs167p protein domains rescued phenotypes associated with deletion of RVS167: salt sensitivity, random budding, and endocytosis and sporulation defects. The BAR domain was sufficient for full or partial rescue of all rvs167 mutant phenotypes tested but not required for the sporulation defect for which the SH3 domain was also sufficient. Overexpression of Rvs167p inhibits cell growth. The BAR domain was essential for this inhibition and the SH3 domain had only a minor effect. Rvs167p may link the cell cycle regulator Pcl-Pho85p kinase and the actin cytoskeleton. We propose that Rvs167p is activated by phosphorylation in its GPA region by the Pcl-Pho85p kinase. Upon activation, Rvs167p enters a multiprotein complex, making critical contacts in its BAR domain and redundant or minor contacts with its SH3 domain.",PMID: 10388809 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Equilibrium folding properties of the yeast prion protein determinant Ure2.,"Perrett S, Freeman SJ, Butler PJ, Fersht AR.",,"Centre for Protein Engineering, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Lensfield Road, Cambridge, CB2 1EW, UK.","The yeast non-Mendelian factor [URE3] propagates by a prion-like mechanism, involving aggregation of the chromosomally encoded protein Ure2. The [URE3] phenotype is equivalent to loss of function of Ure2, a protein involved in regulation of nitrogen metabolism. The prion-like behaviour of Ure2 in vivo is dependent on the first 65 amino acid residues of its N-terminal region which contains a highly repetitive sequence rich in asparagine. This region has been termed the prion-determining domain (PrD). Removal of as little as residues 2-20 of the protein is sufficient to prevent occurrence of the [URE3] phenotype. Removal of the PrD does not affect the regulatory activity of Ure2. The C-terminal portion of the protein has homology to glutathione S -transferases, which are dimeric proteins. We have produced the Ure2 protein to high yield in Escherichia coli from a synthetic gene. The recombinant purified protein is shown to be a dimer. The stability, folding and oligomeric state of Ure2 and a series of N-terminally truncated or deleted variants were studied and compared. The stability of Ure2, DeltaGD-N, H2O, determined by chemical denaturation and monitored by fluorescence, is 12.1(+/-0.4) kcal mol-1at 25 degrees C and pH 8.4. A range of structural probes show a single, coincident unfolding transition, which is invariant over a 550-fold change in protein concentration. The stability is the same within error for Ure2 variants lacking all or part of the prion-determining domain. The data indicate that in the folded protein the PrD is in an unstructured conformation and does not form specific intra- or intermolecular interactions at micromolar protein concentrations. This suggests that the C-terminal domain may stabilise the PrD against prion formation by steric means, and implies that the PrD does not induce prion formation by altering the thermodynamic stability of the folded protein.

An analysis in terms of the contributions from charge-charge interactions to protein stability.,"Ibarra-Molero B, Loladze VV, Makhatadze GI, Sanchez-Ruiz JM.","Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Quimica Fisica, Universidad de Granada, Spain.","We have characterized the guanidine-induced unfolding of both yeast and bovine ubiquitin at 25 degrees C and in the acidic pH range on the basis of fluorescence and circular dichroism measurements. Unfolding Gibbs energy changes calculated by linear extrapolation from high guanidine unfolding data are found to depend very weakly on pH. A simple explanation for this result involves the two following assumptions: (1) charged atoms of ionizable groups are exposed to the solvent in native ubiquitin (as supported by accessible surface area calculations), and Gibbs energy contributions associated with charge desolvation upon folding (a source of pK shifts) are small; (2) charge-charge interactions (another source of pK shifts upon folding) are screened out in concentrated guanidinium chloride solutions. We have also characterized the thermal unfolding of both proteins using differential scanning calorimetry. Unfolding Gibbs energy changes calculated from the calorimetric data do depend strongly on pH, a result that we attribute to the pH dependence of charge-charge interactions (not eliminated in the absence of guanidine). In fact, we find good agreement between the difference between the two series of experimental unfolding Gibbs energy changes (determined from high guanidine unfolding data by linear extrapolation and from thermal denaturation data in the absence of guanidine) and the theoretical estimates of the contribution from charge-charge interactions to the Gibbs energy change for ubiquitin unfolding obtained by using the solvent-accessibility-corrected Tanford-Kirkwood model, together with the Bashford-Karplus (reduced-set-of-sites) approximation. This contribution is found to be stabilizing at neutral pH, because most charged groups on the native protein interact mainly with groups of the opposite charge, a fact that, together with the absence of large charge-desolvation contributions, may explain the high stability of ubiquitin at neutral pH. In general, our analysis suggests the possibility of enhancing protein thermal stability by adequately redesigning the distribution of solvent-exposed, charged residues on the native protein surface.",PMID: 10387059 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

The inhibitor binds by forming a Schiff base link with one of the two invariant lysines at the catalytic center: Lys263. It is known that this lysine forms a Schiff base link with substrate bound at the enzyme's so-called P-site. The carboxyl group of laevulinic acid makes hydrogen bonds with the side-chain-OH groups of Tyr329 and Ser290, as well as with the main-chain >NH group of Ser290. The aliphatic moiety of the inhibitor makes hydrophobic interactions with surrounding aromatic residues in the protein including Phe219, which resides in the flap covering the active site. Our analysis strongly suggests that the same interactions will be made by P-side substrate and also indicates that the substrate that binds at the enzyme's A-site will interact with the enzyme's zinc ion bound by three cysteines (133, 135, and 143). Inhibitor binding caused a substantial ordering of the active site flap (residues 217-235), which was largely invisible in the native electron density map and indicates that this highly conserved yet flexible region has a specific role in substrate binding during catalysis.",PMID: 10386874 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

Consequently, production of antibiotic secondary metabolites and defence mechanisms against these compounds have evolved in these organisms. An experimental model has been developed to study the response in fungi exposed to one such antibiotic. The filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans was treated with bafilomycin B1, a Streptomyces-produced antibiotic which reduces radial growth rate and induces morphological changes in fungi. mRNA differential display was used to study changes in fungal gene expression. For five genes, changes in abundance of the corresponding mRNAs, directly or indirectly caused by bafilomycin, were observed. Of these, three were up-regulated and two repressed. With four of these the change in mRNA abundance measured ranged from 10- to 60-fold. However, for one gene the mRNA was only detected after bafilomycin treatment. One of the down-regulated mRNAs encodes ASPND1, a glycoprotein that belongs to a known family of antigens identified in aspergilloma patients. One up-regulated mRNA shows sequence similarities, at the amino acid level, with a cell-wall protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The remaining three genes were also cloned and sequenced; their sequences do not correspond to known genes in A. nidulans, and no similarities with published nucleotide or protein sequences in other organisms were found.

A two-hybrid screen for Std1-interacting proteins identified the hydrophilic C-terminal domains of the glucose sensors, Snf3 and Rgt2. The homologue of Std1, Mth1, behaves differently from Std1 in this assay by interacting with Snf3 but not Rgt2. Genetic interactions between STD1, MTH1, SNF3, and RGT2 suggest that the glucose signaling is mediated, at least in part, through interactions of the products of these four genes. Mutations in MTH1 can suppress the raffinose growth defect of a snf3 mutant as well as the glucose fermentation defect present in cells lacking both glucose sensors (snf3 rgt2). Genetic suppression by mutations in MTH1 is likely to be due to the increased and unregulated expression of hexose transporter genes. In media lacking glucose or with low levels of glucose, the hexose transporter genes are subject to repression by a mechanism that requires the Std1 and Mth1 proteins. An additional mechanism for glucose sensing must exist since a strain lacking all four genes (snf3 rgt2 std1 mth1) is still able to regulate SUC2 gene expression in response to changes in glucose concentration. Finally, studies with green fluorescent protein fusions indicate that Std1 is localized to the cell periphery and the cell nucleus, supporting the idea that it may transduce signals from the plasma membrane to the nucleus.",PMID: 10373505 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

These biochemical data have been placed in a structural context by the solution of the crystal structures of S. cerevisiae phosphoglycerate mutase soaked with inositol hexakisphosphate or benzene hexacarboxylate. These large polyanionic compounds bind to the enzyme so as to block the entrance to the active-site cleft. They form multiple interactions with the enzyme, consistent with their low Kivalues, and afford good protection against limited proteolysis of the C-terminal region by thermolysin. The inositol compound is more efficacious because of its greater number of negative charges. The S. pombe phosphoglycerate mutase that is inherently lacking a comparable C-terminal region has higher Kivalues for the compounds tested.

Under basal conditions, the human HSF1 protein is maintained as an inactive monomer through intramolecular interactions between two coiled-coil domains and interactions with heat shock proteins; upon environmental, pharmacological, or physiological stress, HSF1 is converted to a homotrimer that binds to its cognate DNA binding site with high affinity. To dissect regions of HSF1 that make important contributions to the stability of the monomer under unstressed conditions, we have used functional complementation in bakers' yeast as a facile assay system. Whereas wild-type human HSF1 is restrained as an inactive monomer in yeast that is unable to substitute for the essential yeast HSF protein, mutations in the linker region between the DNA binding domain and the first coiled-coil allow HSF1 to homotrimerize and rescue the viability defect of a hsfDelta strain. Fine mapping by functional analysis of HSF1-HSF2 chimeras and point mutagenesis revealed that a small region in the amino-terminal portion of the HSF1 linker is required for maintenance of HSF1 in the monomeric state in both yeast and in transfected human 293 cells. Although linker regions in transcription factors are known to modulate DNA binding specificity, our studies suggest that the human HSF1 linker plays no role in determining HSF1 binding preferences in vivo but is a critical determinant in regulating the HSF1 monomer-trimer equilibrium."

Two hybrid systems have been used to identify novel components of signaling networks based on interactions with defined partner proteins. An important issue in the use of two-hybrid systems has been the degree to which interacting proteins distinguish their biological partner from evolutionarily conserved related proteins and the degree to which observed interactions are specific. We adapted the basic two-hybrid strategy to create a novel dual bait system designed to allow single-step screening of libraries for proteins that interact with protein 1 of interest, fused to DNA binding domain A (LexA), but do not interact with protein 2, fused to DNA binding domain B (lambda cI). Using the selective interactions of Ras and Krev-1(Rap1A) with Raf, RalGDS, and Krit1 as a model, we systematically compared LexA- and cI-fused baits and reporters. The LexA and cI baitr reporter systems are well matched for level of bait expression and sensitivity range for interaction detection and allow effective isolation of specifically interacting protein pairs against a nonspecific background. These reagents should prove useful to refine the selectivity of library screens, to reduce the isolation of false positives in such screens, and to perform directed analyses of sequence elements governing the interaction of a single protein with multiple partners."

Cells expressing the cdc42(V44A) effector domain mutant allele displayed morphological defects of highly elongated and multielongated budded cells indicative of a defect in the apical-isotropic switch in bud growth. In addition, these cells contained one, two, or multiple nuclei indicative of a G2/M delay in nuclear division and also a defect in cytokinesis and/or cell separation. Actin and chitin were delocalized, and septin ring structure was aberrant and partially delocalized to the tips of elongated cdc42(V44A) cells; however, Cdc42(V44A)p localization was normal. Two-hybrid protein analyses showed that the V44A mutation interfered with Cdc42p's interactions with Cla4p, a p21(Cdc42/Rac)-activated kinase (PAK)-like kinase, and the novel effectors Gic1p and Gic2p, but not with the Ste20p or Skm1p PAK-like kinases, the Bni1p formin, or the Iqg1p IQGAP homolog. Furthermore, the cdc42(V44A) morphological defects were suppressed by deletion of the Swe1p cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory kinase and by overexpression of Cla4p, Ste20p, the Cdc12 septin protein, or the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Cdc24p. In sum, these results suggest that proper Cdc42p function is essential for timely progression through the apical-isotropic switch and G2/M transition and that Cdc42(V44A)p differentially interacts with a number of effectors and regulators."

Synapsins contain a central ATP-binding domain, the C-domain, that is highly homologous between synapsins and evolutionarily conserved in invertebrates. The crystal structure of the C-domain from synapsin I revealed that it constitutes a large (>300 amino acids), independently folded domain that forms a tight dimer with or without bound ATP. We now show that the C-domains of all synapsins form homodimers, and that in addition, C-domains from different synapsins associate into heterodimers. This conclusion is based on four findings: 1) in yeast two-hybrid screens with full-length synapsin IIa as a bait, the most frequently isolated prey cDNAs encoded the C-domain of synapsins; 2) quantitative yeast two-hybrid protein-protein binding assays demonstrated pairwise strong interactions between all synapsins; 3) immunoprecipitations from transfected COS cells confirmed that synapsin II heteromultimerizes with synapsins I and III in intact cells, and similar results were obtained with bacterial expression systems; and 4) quantification of the synapsin III level in synapsin I/II double knockout mice showed that the level of synapsin III is decreased by 50%, indicating that heteromultimerization of synapsin III with synapsins I or II occurs in vivo and is required for protein stabilization. These data suggest that synapsins coat the surface of synaptic vesicles as homo- and heterodimers in which the C-domains of the various subunits have distinct regulatory properties and are flanked by variable C-terminal sequences. The data also imply that synapsin III does not compensate for the loss of synapsins I and II in the double knockout mice."

The 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene encoding the AP1-like transcription factor Yap2 contains two upstream open reading frames (uORF1 and uORF2). The YAP2-type of uORF functions as a cis-acting element that attenuates gene expression at the level of mRNA turnover via termination-dependent decay. Release of post-termination ribosomes from the YAP2 5'UTR causes accelerated decay which is largely independent of the termination modulator gene UPF1. Both of the YAP2 uORFs contribute to the destabilization effect. A G/C-rich stop codon context, which seems to promote ribosome release, allows an uORF to act as a transferable 5'UTR-destabilizing element. Moreover, termination-dependent destabilization is potentiated by stable secondary structure 3' of the uORF stop codon. The potentiation of uORF-mediated destabilization is eliminated if the secondary structure is located further downstream of the uORF, and is also influenced by a modulatory mechanism involving eIF2. Destabilization is therefore linked to the kinetics of acquisition of reinitiation-competence by post-termination ribosomes in the 5'UTR. Our data explain the destabilizing properties of YAP2-type uORFs and also support a more general model for the mode of action of other known uORFs, such as those in the GCN4 mRNA."

Two different cDNA clones, which interacted with Ro52 in the yeast two-hybrid system, were identified and isolated from a human B-cell library. Surprisingly, both clones encoded the heavy chain of human IgG1. The expression of both HIS3 and beta-galactosidase reporter genes in yeast suggested that the interaction between Ro52 and IgG occurred in vivo. In vitro studies utilizing recombinant Ro52 and purified immunoglobulins indicated that the interaction was immunoglobulin class and subclass specific. Ro52 interacted with IgG1 and IgG4, but not with IgG2, IgG3, IgA or IgM. Ro52 could also precipitate IgG directly from serum. The identified cDNA clones did not include the variable region of IgG, which suggested a non-classical interaction independent of antibody specificity. We further mapped the domain of Ro52 responsible for this interaction to the C-terminus rfp-like region. In conclusion, our data support an unusual interaction between native Ro52 and IgG. The potential biological significance of this unusual protein-protein interaction is discussed."

Believing that simple and complex kinetochores have important structural and functional properties in common, we characterized the structure of CBF3, the essential centromere-binding complex that initiates kinetochore formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that the four subunits of CBF3 are multimeric in solution: p23(Skp1) and p58(Ctf13) form a heterodimer, and p64(Cep3) and p110(Ndc10) form homodimers. Subcomplexes involving p58 and each of the other CBF3 subunits can assemble in the absence of centromeric DNA. In these subcomplexes, p58 appears to function as a structural core mediating stable interactions among other CBF3 proteins. p58 has a short half-life in yeast, being subject to ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, but we find that it is much more stable following association with p64. We propose that p23(Skp1)-p58-p64 complexes constitute the primary pool of active p58 in yeast cells. These complexes can either dissociate, reexposing p58 to the degradation pathway, or can bind to p110 and centromeric DNA, forming a functional CBF3 complex in which p58 is fully protected from degradation. This pathway may constitute an editing mechanism preventing the formation of ectopic kinetochores and ensuring the fidelity of chromosome segregation."

Bacterial glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase poorly aminoacylates yeast tRNA and, as a consequence, cannot rescue a knockout allele of the gene for the yeast homologue. In contrast to the bacterial protein, the yeast enzyme has an extra appended domain at the N terminus. Previously, we showed that fusion of this yeast-specific domain to the bacterial protein enabled it to function as a yeast enzyme in vivo and in vitro. We suggested that the novel yeast-specific domain contributed to RNA interactions in a way that compensated for the poor fit between the yeast tRNA and bacterial enzyme. Here we establish that the novel appended domain by itself binds nonspecifically to different RNA structures. In addition, we show that fusion of an unrelated yeast protein, Arc1p, to the bacterial enzyme also converts it into a functional yeast enzyme in vivo and in vitro. A small C-terminal segment of Arc1p is necessary and sufficient for this conversion. This segment was shown by others to have nonspecific tRNA binding properties. Thus, nonspecific RNA binding interactions in general can compensate for barriers to formation of a specific and essential RNA.protein complex."

P., Leslie, A. G., Lutter, R., and Walker, J. E. (1994) Nature 370, 621-628). The role of the domains was studied by making chimeric enzymes, replacing the domains from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae enzyme with the corresponding domains from the enzyme of the thermophilic bacterium Bacillus PS3. The enzymes containing the chimeric alpha-, beta-, or alpha- and beta-subunits were not functional. However, gain-of-function mutations were obtained from the strain containing the enzyme with the chimeric PS3/yeast beta-subunit. The gain-of-function mutations were all in codons encoding the beta-barrel domain of the beta-subunit, and the residues appear to map out a region of subunit-subunit interactions. Gain-of-function mutations were also obtained that provided functional expression of the chimeric PS3/yeast alpha- and beta-subunits together. Biochemical analysis of this active chimeric enzyme indicated that it was not significantly more thermostable or labile than the wild type. The results of this study indicate that the beta-barrel domains form critical contacts (distinct from those between the alpha- and beta-subunits) that are important for the assembly of the ATP synthase."

Necdin, like the retinoblastoma protein, interacts with cell cycle promoting proteins such as simian virus 40 large T antigen, adenovirus E1A, and the transcription factor E2F1. Here we demonstrate that necdin interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53 as well. The yeast two-hybrid and in vitro binding analyses revealed that necdin bound to a narrow region (amino acids 35-62) located between the MDM2-binding site and the proline-rich region in the amino-terminal domain of p53. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that necdin supershifted a complex between p53 and its binding DNA, implying that the p53-necdin complex is competent for DNA binding. In p53-deficient osteosarcoma SAOS-2 cells, necdin markedly suppressed p53-dependent activation of the p21/WAF promoter. Necdin and p53 inhibited cell growth in an additive manner as assessed by the colony formation of SAOS-2 cells, suggesting that necdin does not affect p53-mediated growth suppression. On the other hand, necdin inhibited p53-induced apoptosis of osteosarcoma U2OS cells. Thus, necdin can be a growth suppressor that targets p53 and modulates its biological functions in postmitotic neurons."

The npr1 mutant plants fail to respond to systemic acquired resistance-inducing signals such as salicylic acid (SA), or express SA-induced pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. Using NPR1 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified a subclass of transcription factors in the basic leucine zipper protein family (AHBP-1b and TGA6) and showed that they interact specifically in yeast and in vitro with NPR1. Point mutations that abolish the NPR1 function in A. thaliana also impair the interactions between NPR1 and the transcription factors in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Furthermore, a gel mobility shift assay showed that the purified transcription factor protein, AHBP-1b, binds specifically to an SA-responsive promoter element of the A. thaliana PR-1 gene. These data suggest that NPR1 may regulate PR-1 gene expression by interacting with a subclass of basic leucine zipper protein transcription factors."

These mutants were collectively called las mutants (local anestheticum sensitive). The las21 mutants were analyzed in this study. The wild type LAS21 gene was cloned by exploiting temperature sensitivity of the las21 mutants and we found that LAS21 encodes ORF YJL062w which has not been analyzed before. Las21p is putative membrane protein belonging to the major facilitator super family containing plural membrane spanning domains. Complete elimination of the LAS21 ORF did not kill the cells but made their growth temperature sensitive. Interestingly, the complete loss of the LAS21 gene canceled the sensitivity to tetracaine. The ability of the las21 mutants to grow at a higher temperature was recovered in the various media containing an osmotic stabilizer or salts. Furthermore, temperature sensitivity of the las21 mutants was partially suppressed by introduction of PKC1, encoding protein kinase C, on a high copy vector. We found some genetic interactions between LAS21 and Ras/cAMP cascade genes. These results suggest that LAS21 defines unknown pathway regulating the stress response of yeast."

While the DRPLA gene is ubiquitously expressed, neuron death occurs in specific anatomical areas of the brain. This predicts that the DRPLA protein interacts with other proteins and that these interactions may play a role in pathogenesis. Here, we describe a protein that binds to the DRPLA product. One of the clones isolated with a yeast two-hybrid system was identified as a human homolog of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate protein of 53 kDa (IRSp53). The gene produced two mRNA forms by differential splicing and encoded 552 and 521 amino acids, respectively. The longer form was mainly expressed in the brain and the shorter one in other tissues. The products were phosphorylated upon stimulation of cultured cells with insulin or insulin-like growth factor 1. Binding of the DRPLA protein to IRSp53 was ascertained by co-immunoprecipitation with antibodies and also by co-localization in perinuclear oval dots in cells expressing engineered constructs. A proline-rich region near the polyglutamine tract of the DRPLA protein and the SH3 domain of IRSp53 were involved in the binding. An extended polyglutamine tract significantly reduced binding ability in yeast cells, but not in in vitro binding assays. The identification of IRSp53 and other proteins detected by the yeast hybrid system predicts that DRPLA functions in a signal transduction pathway coupled with insulin/IGF-1."

We identified mutations in ten genes, designated LST (lethal with sec-thirteen), that were lethal in combination with the COPII mutation sec13-1. LST1 showed synthetic-lethal interactions with the complete set of COPII genes, indicating that LST1 encodes a new COPII function. LST1 codes for a protein similar in sequence to the COPII subunit Sec24p. Like Sec24p, Lst1p is a peripheral ER membrane protein that binds to the COPII subunit Sec23p. Chromosomal deletion of LST1 is not lethal, but inhibits transport of the plasma membrane proton-ATPase (Pma1p) to the cell surface, causing poor growth on media of low pH. Localization by both immunofluorescence microscopy and cell fractionation shows that the export of Pma1p from the ER is impaired in lst1Delta mutants. Transport of other proteins from the ER was not affected by lst1Delta, nor was Pma1p transport found to be particularly sensitive to other COPII defects. Together, these findings suggest that a specialized form of the COPII coat subunit, with Lst1p in place of Sec24p, is used for the efficient packaging of Pma1p into vesicles derived from the ER."

The functions of the DIX domains of Dvl-1 and Axin were investigated. By yeast two-hybrid screening, the DIX domain of Dvl-1 was found to interact with Dvl-3, a second mammalian Dishevelled relative. The DIX domains of Dvl-1 and Dvl-3 directly bound one another. Furthermore, Dvl-1 formed a homo-oligomer. Axin also formed a homo-oligomer, and its DIX domain was necessary. The N-terminal region of Dvl-1, including its DIX domain, bound to Axin directly. Dvl-1 inhibited Axin-promoted glycogen synthase kinase 3beta-dependent phosphorylation of beta-catenin, and the DIX domain of Dvl-1 was required for this inhibitory activity. Expression of Dvl-1 in L cells induced the nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin, and deletion of the DIX domain abolished this activity. Although expression of Axin in SW480 cells caused the degradation of beta-catenin and reduced the cell growth rate, expression of an Axin mutant that lacks the DIX domain did not affect the level of beta-catenin or the growth rate. These results indicate that the DIX domains of Dvl-1 and Axin are important for protein-protein interactions and that they are necessary for the ability of Dvl-1 and Axin to regulate the stability of beta-catenin."
,741: Mol Cell Biol  1999 Jun;19(6):4324-33 ,A new class of repression modules is critical for heme regulation of the yeast transcriptional activator Hap1.,"Hach A, Hon T, Zhang L.","Department of Biochemistry, NYU Medical Center, New York, New York 10016, USA.","Heme plays key regulatory roles in numerous molecular and cellular processes for systems that sense or use oxygen. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, oxygen sensing and heme signaling are mediated by heme activator protein 1 (Hap1). Hap1 contains seven heme-responsive motifs (HRMs): six are clustered in the heme domain, and a seventh is near the activation domain. To determine the functional role of HRMs and to define which parts of Hap1 mediate heme regulation, we carried out a systematic analysis of Hap1 mutants with various regions deleted or mutated. Strikingly, the data show that HRM1 to -6, located in the previously designated Hap1 heme domain, have little impact on heme regulation. All seven HRMs are dispensable for Hap1 repression in the absence of heme, but HRM7 is required for Hap1 activation by heme. More importantly, we show that a novel class of repression modules-RPM1, encompassing residues 245 to 278; RPM2, encompassing residues 1061 to 1185; and RPM3, encompassing residues 203 to 244-is critical for Hap1 repression in the absence of heme. Biochemical analysis indicates that RPMs mediate Hap1 repression, at least partly, by the formation of a previously identified higher-order complex termed the high-molecular-weight complex (HMC), while HRMs mediate heme activation by permitting heme binding and the disassembly of the HMC. These findings provide significant new insights into the molecular interactions critical for Hap1 repression in the absence of heme and Hap1 activation by heme."

Recent findings indicate that Gcd10p and Gcd14p reside in a nuclear complex required for the presence of 1-methyladenosine in tRNAs. Here we show that Gcd14p is an essential protein with predicted binding motifs for S-adenosylmethionine, consistent with a direct function in tRNA methylation. Two different gcd14 mutants exhibit defects in cell growth and accumulate high levels of initiator methionyl-tRNA (tRNAiMet) precursors containing 5' and 3' extensions, suggesting a defect in processing of the primary transcript. Dosage suppressors of gcd10 mutations, encoding tRNAiMet (hcIMT1 to hcIMT4; hc indicates that the gene is carried on a high-copy-number plasmid) or a homologue of human La protein implicated in tRNA 3'-end formation (hcLHP1), also suppressed gcd14 mutations. In fact, the lethality of a GCD14 deletion was suppressed by hcIMT4, indicating that the essential function of Gcd14p is required for biogenesis of tRNAiMet. A mutation in GCD10 or deletion of LHP1 exacerbated the defects in cell growth and expression of mature tRNAiMet in gcd14 mutants, consistent with functional interactions between Gcd14p, Gcd10p, and Lhp1p in vivo. Surprisingly, the amounts of NME1 and RPR1, the RNA components of RNases P and MRP, were substantially lower in gcd14 lhp1::LEU2 double mutants than in the corresponding single mutants, whereas 5S rRNA was present at wild-type levels.

Current antifungal drug therapies are limited and suffer from toxic side effects and drug resistance. Here, we defined the targets and mechanisms of antifungal action of the immunosuppressant rapamycin in C. neoformans. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in T cells, rapamycin forms complexes with the FKBP12 prolyl isomerase that block cell cycle progression by inhibiting the TOR kinases. We identified the gene encoding a C. neoformans TOR1 homolog. Using a novel two-hybrid screen for rapamycin-dependent TOR-binding proteins, we identified the C. neoformans FKBP12 homolog, encoded by the FRR1 gene. Disruption of the FKBP12 gene conferred rapamycin and FK506 resistance but had no effect on growth, differentiation, or virulence of C. neoformans. Two spontaneous mutations that confer rapamycin resistance alter conserved residues on TOR1 or FKBP12 that are required for FKBP12-rapamycin-TOR1 interactions or FKBP12 stability. Two other spontaneous mutations result from insertion of novel DNA sequences into the FKBP12 gene. Our observations reveal that the antifungal activities of rapamycin and FK506 are mediated via FKBP12 and TOR homologs and that a high proportion of spontaneous mutants in C. neoformans result from insertion of novel DNA sequences, and they suggest that nonimmunosuppressive rapamycin analogs have potential as antifungal agents."

All four mammalian IRS proteins contain pleckstrin homology (PH) and phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains at their N termini. However, the molecules diverge in their C-terminal sequences. IRS3 is considerably shorter than IRS1, IRS2, and IRS4, and is predicted to interact with a distinct group of downstream signaling molecules. In the present study, we investigated interactions of IRS3 with various signaling molecules. The PTB domain of mIRS3 is necessary and sufficient for binding to the juxtamembrane NPXpY motif of the insulin receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system. This interaction is stronger if the PH domain or the C-terminal phosphorylation domain is retained in the construct. As determined in a modified yeast two-hybrid system, mIRS3 bound strongly to the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Although high affinity interaction required the presence of at least two of the four YXXM motifs in mIRS3, there was not a requirement for specific YXXM motifs. mIRS3 also bound to SHP2, Grb2, Nck, and Shc, but less strongly than to p85. Studies in COS-7 cells demonstrated that deletion of either the PH or the PTB domain abolished insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of mIRS3. Insulin stimulation promoted the association of mIRS3 with p85, SHP2, Nck, and Shc. Despite weak association between mIRS3 and Grb2, this interaction was not increased by insulin, and may not be mediated by the SH2 domain of Grb2. Thus, in contrast to other IRS proteins, mIRS3 appears to have greater specificity for activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway rather than the Grb2/Ras pathway."

We cloned rabbit reticulocyte E217K because unlike the similarly sized class I E2s, E214K and UBC4, it is unable to support ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3)-dependent conjugation to endogenous proteins. RNA analysis revealed that this E2 was expressed in all tissues tested, with higher levels in the testis. Analysis of testis RNA from rats of different ages showed that E217K mRNA was induced from days 15 to 30. The predicted amino acid sequence indicates that E217K is a 19. 5-kDa class I E2 but differs from other class I enzymes in possessing an insertion of 13 amino acids distal to the active site cysteine. E217K shows 74% amino acid identity with Saccharomyces cerevisiae UBC7, and therefore, we rename it mammalian UBC7. Yeast UBC7 crystal structure indicates that this insertion forms a loop out of the otherwise conserved folding structure. Sequence analysis of E2s had previously suggested that this loop is a hypervariable region and may play a role in substrate specificity. We created mutant UBC7 lacking the loop (ubc7Deltaloop) and a mutant E214k with an inserted loop (E214k+loop) and characterized their biochemical functions. Ubc7Deltaloop had higher affinity for the E1-Ub thiol ester than native UBC7 and permitted conjugation of Ub to selected proteins in the testis but did not permit the broad spectrum E3-dependent conjugation to endogenous reticulocyte proteins. Surprisingly, E214k+loop was unable to accept Ub from ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) but was able to accept NEDD8 from E1. E214k+loop was able to support conjugation of NEDD8 to endogenous reticulocyte proteins but with much lower efficiency than E214k. Thus, the loop can influence interactions of the E2 with charged E1 as well as with E3s or substrates, but the exact nature of these interactions depends on divergent sequences in the remaining conserved core domain."

Bck1p functions as the MAP kinase kinase kinase of this pathway. Here we report on the cloning and analysis of the BCK1 homolog from the milk yeast Kluyveromyces lactis (KlBCK1). The deduced protein sequences display three highly conserved domains with the serine/threonine kinase domain containing 89 % identical amino acid residues. Interestingly, a region identified in KlBck1p as a putative SAM domain, mediating protein-protein interactions, is also conserved in ScBck1p. Yet, two-hybrid analyses indicate that this region may not be involved in dimerization of KlBck1p in contrast to its S. cerevisiae counterpart. Expression of KlBCK1 fully complements the defects in a Scbck1 null mutant and is capable of activating the pathway as indicated by a reporter system based on the transcription factor Rlm1p. However, deletion from the haploid K. lactis genome does not result in a loss of cellular integrity under a variety of conditions tested. Thus, despite the functional conservation in this component of the MAP kinase pathway in both yeast, cellular integrity in K. lactis may depend at least in part on different signalling mechanisms when compared with S. cerevisiae.

"The PRS gene family in Saccharomyces cerevisiae consists of five genes each capable of encoding a 5-phosphoribosyl-1(alpha)-pyrophosphate synthetase polypeptide. To gain insight into the functional organization of this gene family we have constructed a collection of strains containing all possible combinations of disruptions in the five PRS genes. Phenotypically these deletant strains can be classified into three groups: (i) a lethal phenotype that corresponds to strains containing a double disruption in PRS2 and PRS4 in combination with a disruption in either PRS1 or PRS3; simultaneous deletion of PRS1 and PRS5 or PRS3 and PRS5 are also lethal combinations; (ii) a second phenotype that is encountered in strains containing disruptions in PRS1 and PRS3 together or in combination with any of the other PRS genes manifests itself as a reduction in growth rate, enzyme activity, and nucleotide content; (iii) a third phenotype that corresponds to strains that, although affected in their phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate-synthesizing ability, are unimpaired for growth and have nucleotide profiles virtually the same as the wild type. Deletions of PRS2, PRS4, and PRS5 or combinations thereof cause this phenotype. These results suggest that the polypeptides encoded by the members of the PRS gene family may be organized into two functional entities. Evidence that these polypeptides interact with each other in vivo was obtained using the yeast two-hybrid system. Specifically PRS1 and PRS3 polypeptides interact strongly with each other, and there are significant interactions between the PRS5 polypeptide and either the PRS2 or PRS4 polypeptides. These data suggest that yeast phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase exists in vivo as multimeric complex(es).",PMID: 10212224 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,766: Curr Biol  1999 Mar 25;9(6):325-8 ,Mouse Rad54 affects DNA conformation and DNA-damage-induced Rad51 foci formation.
"Error-free repair by homologous recombination of DNA double-strand breaks induced by ionizing radiation (IR) requires the Rad52 group proteins, including Rad51 and Rad54, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [1]. The formation of a 'joint' molecule between the damaged DNA and the homologous repair template is a key step in recombination mediated by Rad51 and stimulated by Rad54 [2] [3] [4] [5]. Mammalian homologs of Rad51 and Rad54 have been identified [2] [3] [6]. Here, we demonstrate that mouse Rad54 (mRad54) formed IR-induced nuclear foci that colocalized with mRad51. Interaction between mRad51 and mRad54 was induced by genotoxic stress, but only when lesions that required mRad54 for their repair were formed. Interestingly, mRad54 was essential for the formation of IR-induced mRad51 foci. Rad54 belongs to the SWI2/SNF2 protein family, members of which modulate protein-DNA interactions in an ATP-driven manner [7]. Results of a topological assay suggested that purified human Rad54 (hRad54) protein can unwind double-stranded (ds) DNA at the expense of ATP hydrolysis. Unwinding of the homologous repair template could promote the formation or stabilization of hRad51-mediated joint molecules. Rad54 appears to be required downstream of other Rad52 group proteins, such as Rad52 and the Rad55-Rad57 heterodimer, that assist Rad51 in interacting with the broken DNA [2] [3] [4].",PMID: 10209103 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,767: Mol Cell Biol  1999 May;19(5):3580-7 ,"Rho3 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which regulates the actin cytoskeleton and exocytosis, is a GTPase which interacts with Myo2 and Exo70."
"The Rho3 protein plays a critical role in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by directing proper cell growth. Rho3 appears to influence cell growth by regulating polarized secretion and the actin cytoskeleton, since rho3 mutants exhibit large rounded cells with an aberrant actin cytoskeleton. To gain insights into how Rho3 influences these events, we have carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen using an S. cerevisiae cDNA library to identify proteins interacting with Rho3. Two proteins, Exo70 and Myo2, were identified in this screen. Interactions with these two proteins are greatly reduced or abolished when mutations are introduced into the Rho3 effector domain. In addition, a type of mutation known to produce dominant negative mutants of Rho proteins abolished the interaction with both of these proteins. In contrast, Rho3 did not interact with protein kinase C (Pkc1), an effector of another Rho family protein, Rho1, nor did Rho1 interact with Exo70 or Myo2. Rho3 did interact with Bni1, another effector of Rho1, but less efficiently than with Rho1. The interaction between Rho3 and Exo70 and between Rho3 and Myo2 was also demonstrated with purified proteins. The interaction between Exo70 and Rho3 in vitro was dependent on the presence of GTP, since Rho3 complexed with guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) interacted more efficiently with Exo70 than Rho3 complexed with guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiodiphosphate). Overlapping subcellular localization of the Rho3 and Exo70 proteins was demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence. In addition, patterns of localization of both Exo70 and Rho3 were altered when a dominant active allele of RHO3, RHO3(E129,A131), which causes a morphological abnormality, was expressed. These results provide a direct molecular basis for the action of Rho3 on exocytosis and the actin cytoskeleton.",PMID: 10207081 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,768: EMBO J  1999 Apr 15;18(8):2229-40 ,Role of the essential yeast protein PSU1 in p6anscriptional enhancement by the ligand-dependent activation function AF-2 of nuclear receptors.
"Nuclear receptors (NRs) can function as ligandinducible transregulators in both mammalian and yeast cells, indicating that important features of transcriptional control have been conserved throughout evolution. We report here the isolation and characterization of an essential yeast protein of unknown function, PSU1, which exhibits properties expected for a co-activator/mediator of the ligand-dependent activation function AF-2 present in the ligand-binding domain (LBD, region E) of NRs. PSU1 interacts in a ligand-dependent manner with the LBD of several NRs, including retinoic acid (RARalpha), retinoid X (RXRalpha), thyroid hormone (TRalpha), vitamin D3 (VDR) and oestrogen (ERalpha) receptors. Importantly, both in yeast and in vitro, these interactions require the integrity of the AF-2 activating domain. When tethered to a heterologous DNA-binding domain, PSU1 can activate transcription on its own. By using yeast reporter cells that express PSU1 conditionally, we show that PSU1 is required for transactivation by the AF-2 of ERalpha. Taken together these data suggest that in yeast, PSU1 is involved in ligand-dependent transactivation by NRs. Sequence analysis revealed that in addition to a highly conserved motif found in a family of MutT-related proteins, PSU1 contains several alpha-helical leucine-rich motifs sharing the consensus sequence LLxPhiL (x, any amino acid; Phi, hydrophobic amino acid) in regions that elicit either transactivation or NR-binding activity.",PMID: 10205176 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,769: J Immunol  1999 Apr 15;162(8):5019-24 ,Mutations that cause the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome impair the interaction of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) with WASP interacting protein.
"Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia, eczema, immune deficiency, and a proclivity toward lymphoid malignancy. Lymphocytes of affected individuals show defects of activation, motility, and cytoskeletal structure. The disease gene encodes a 502-amino acid protein named the WAS protein (WASP). Studies have identified a number of important interactions that place WASP in a role of integrating signaling pathways with cytoskeletal function. We performed a two-hybrid screen to identify proteins interacting with WASP and cloned a proline-rich protein as a specific WASP interactor. Our clone of this protein, termed WASP interacting protein (WIP) by others, shows a difference in seven amino acid residues, compared with the previously published sequence revealing an additional profilin binding motif. Deletion mutant analysis reveals that WASP residues 101-151 are necessary for WASP-WIP interaction. Point mutant analyses in the two-hybrid system and in vitro show impairment of WASP-WIP interaction with three WASP missense mutants known to cause WAS. We conclude that impaired WASP-WIP interaction may contribute to WAS.",PMID: 10202051 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,770: Nucleic Acids Res  1999 May 1;27(9):1978-84 ,The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sgs1 helicase efficiently unwinds G-G paired DNAs.
"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sgs1p helicase localizes to the nucleolus and is required to maintain the integrity of the rDNA repeats. Sgs1p is a member of the RecQ DNA helicase family, which also includes Schizo-saccharomyces pombe Rqh1, and the human BLM and WRN genes. These genes encode proteins which are essential to maintenance of genomic integrity and which share a highly conserved helicase domain. Here we show that recombinant Sgs1p helicase efficiently unwinds guanine-guanine (G-G) paired DNA. Unwinding of G-G paired DNA is ATP- and Mg2+-dependent and requires a short 3' single-stranded tail. Strikingly, Sgs1p unwinds G-G paired substrates more efficiently than duplex DNAs, as measured either in direct assays or by competition experiments. Sgs1p efficiently unwinds G-G paired telomeric sequences, suggesting that one function of Sgs1p may be to prevent telomere-telomere interactions which can lead to chromosome non-disjunction. The rDNA is G-rich and has considerable potential for G-G pairing. Diminished ability to unwind G-G paired regions may also explain the deleterious effect of mutation of Sgs1 on rDNA stability, and the accelerated aging characteristic of yeast strains that lack Sgs1 as well as humans deficient in the related WRN helicase.",PMID: 10198430 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,771: Genetics  1999 Apr;151(4):1459-70 ,"Dna2 mutants reveal interactions with Dna polymerase alpha and Ctf4, a Pol alpha accessory factor, and show that full Dna2 helicase activity is not essential for growth."
"Mutations in the gene for the conserved, essential nuclease-helicase Dna2 from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae were found to interact genetically with POL1 and CTF4, which encode a DNA Polymerase alpha subunit and an associated protein, suggesting that Dna2 acts in a process that involves Pol alpha. DNA2 alleles were isolated that cause either temperature sensitivity, sensitivity to alkylation damage, or both. The alkylation-sensitive alleles clustered in the helicase domain, including changes in residues required for helicase activity in related proteins. Additional mutations known or expected to destroy the ATPase and helicase activities of Dna2 were constructed and found to support growth on some media but to cause alkylation sensitivity. Only damage-sensitive alleles were lethal in combination with a ctf4 deletion. Full activity of the Dna2 helicase function is therefore not needed for viability, but is required for repairing damage and for tolerating loss of Ctf4. Arrest of dna2 mutants was RAD9 dependent, but deleting this checkpoint resulted in either no effect or suppression of defects, including the synthetic lethality with ctf4. Dna2 therefore appears to act in repair or lagging strand synthesis together with Pol alpha and Ctf4, in a role that is optimal with, but does not require, full helicase activity.",PMID: 10101169 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,772: Genetics  1999 Apr;151(4):1353-63 ,Suppression of a nuclear aep2 mutation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by a base substitution in the 5'-untranslated region of the mitochondrial oli1 gene encoding subunit 9 of ATP synthase.
"Mutations in the nuclear AEP2 gene of Saccharomyces generate greatly reduced levels of the mature form of mitochondrial oli1 mRNA, encoding subunit 9 of mitochondrial ATP synthase. A series of mutants was isolated in which the temperature-sensitive phenotype resulting from the aep2-ts1 mutation was suppressed. Three strains were classified as containing a mitochondrial suppressor: these lost the ability to suppress aep2-ts1 when their mitochondrial genome was replaced with wild-type mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Many other isolates were classified as containing dominant nuclear suppressors. The three mitochondrion-encoded suppressors were localized to the oli1 region of mtDNA using rho- genetic mapping techniques coupled with PCR analysis; DNA sequencing revealed, in each case, a T-to-C nucleotide transition in mtDNA 16 nucleotides upstream of the oli1 reading frame. It is inferred that the suppressing mutation in the 5' untranslated region of oli1 mRNA restores subunit 9 biosynthesis by accommodating the modified structure of Aep2p generated by the aep2-ts1 mutation (shown here to cause the substitution of proline for leucine at residue 413 of Aep2p). This mode of mitochondrial suppression is contrasted with that mediated by heteroplasmic rearranged rho- mtDNA genomes bypassing the participation of a nuclear gene product in expression of a particular mitochondrial gene. In the present study, direct RNA-protein interactions are likely to form the basis of suppression.",PMID: 10101162 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,773: Genetics  1999 Apr;151(4):1273-85 ,Analysis of mutations in the yeast mRNA decapping enzyme.
"A major mechanism of mRNA decay in yeast is initiated by deadenylation, followed by mRNA decapping, which exposes the transcript to 5' to 3' exonucleolytic degradation. The decapping enzyme that removes the 5' cap structure is encoded by the DCP1 gene. To understand the function of the decapping enzyme, we used alanine scanning mutagenesis to create 31 mutant versions of the enzyme, and we examined the effects of the mutations both in vivo and in vitro. Two types of mutations that affected mRNA decapping in vivo were identified, including a temperature-sensitive allele. First, two mutants produced decapping enzymes that were defective for decapping in vitro, suggesting that these mutated residues are required for enzymatic activity. In contrast, several mutants that moderately affected mRNA decapping in vivo yielded decapping enzymes that had at least the same specific activity as the wild-type enzyme in vitro. Combination of alleles within this group yielded decapping enzymes that showed a strong loss of function in vivo, but that still produced fully active enzymes in vitro. This suggested that interactions of the decapping enzyme with other factors may be required for efficient decapping in vivo, and that these particular mutations may be disrupting such interactions. Interestingly, partial loss of decapping activity in vivo led to a defect in normal deadenylation-dependent decapping, but it did not affect the rapid deadenylation-independent decapping triggered by early nonsense codons. This observation suggested that these two types of mRNA decapping differ in their requirements for the decapping enzyme.",PMID: 10101156 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,774: Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A  1999 Mar 30;96(7):3572-7 ,"Crystal structure of human p32, a doughnut-shaped acidic mitochondrial matrix protein."
"Human p32 (also known as SF2-associated p32, p32/TAP, and gC1qR) is a conserved eukaryotic protein that localizes predominantly in the mitochondrial matrix. It is thought to be involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and in nucleus-mitochondrion interactions. We report the crystal structure of p32 determined at 2.25 A resolution. The structure reveals that p32 adopts a novel fold with seven consecutive antiparallel beta-strands flanked by one N-terminal and two C-terminal alpha-helices. Three monomers form a doughnut-shaped quaternary structure with an unusually asymmetric charge distribution on the surface.

"Translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2) is a large protein of more than 800 amino acids which establishes complex interactions with the ribosome in order to catalyze the conformational changes needed for translation elongation. Unlike other yeasts, the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans was found to have a single gene encoding this factor per haploid genome, located on chromosome 2. Expression of this locus is essential for vegetative growth, as evidenced by placing it under the control of a repressible promoter. This C. albicans gene, named EFT2, was cloned and sequenced (EMBL accession number Y09664). Genomic and cDNA sequence analysis identified common transcription initiation and termination signals and an 842 amino acid open reading frame (ORF), which is interrupted by a single intron. Despite some genetic differences, CaEFT2 was capable of complementing a Saccharomyces cerevisiae Deltaeft1 Deltaeft2 null mutant, which lacks endogenous eEF2, indicating that CaEFT2 can be expressed from its own promoter and its intron can be correctly spliced in S. cerevisiae.",PMID: 10095118 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,776: Eur J Biochem  1999 Feb;259(3):939-45 ,Site-directed mutagenesis of proline 204 in the 'hinge' region of yeast phosphoglycerate kinase.
"Site-specific mutants have been produced in order to investigate the role of proline 204 in the 'hinge' region of yeast phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). This totally conserved proline has been shown to be the only cis-proline in the high resolution crystal structures of yeast, B. stearothermophilus, T. brucei and T. maritima PGK, and may therefore have a role in the independent folding of the two domains or in the 'hinge' bending of the molecule during catalysis. The residue was replaced by a histidine (Pro204His) and a phenylalanine (Pro204Phe), and the resulting proteins characterised by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), circular dichroism (CD), tryptophan fluorescence emission and kinetic analysis. Although the secondary and tertiary structure of the Pro204His protein is generally similar to that of the wild-type enzyme as assessed by CD, the enzyme is less stable to heat and guanidinium chloride denaturation than the wild-type. In the denaturation experiments two transitions were observed for both the wild-type and the Pro204His mutant, as have been previously reported for yeast PGK [Missiakas, D., Betton, J.M., Minard, P. & Yon, J.M. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 8683-8689]. The first transition is accompanied by an increase in fluorescence intensity leading to a hyperfluorescent state, followed by the second, corresponding to a decrease in fluorescence intensity. However, for the Pro204His mutant, the first transition proceeded at lower concentrations of guanidinium chloride and the second transition proceeded to the same extent as for the wild-type protein, suggesting that sequence-distant interactions are more rapidly disrupted in this mutant enzyme than in the wild-type enzyme, while sequence-local interactions are disrupted in a similar way. The Michaelis constants (K(m)) for both 3-phospho-D-glycerate and ATP are increased only by three or fourfold, which confirms that, as expected, the substrate binding sites are largely unaffected by the mutation. However, the turnover and efficiency of the Pro204His mutant is severely impaired, indicating that the mechanism of 'hinge' bending is hindered. The Pro204Phe enzyme was shown to be significantly less well folded than the wild-type and Pro204His enzymes, with considerable loss of both secondary and tertiary structure. It is proposed that the proline residue at 204 in the 'hinge' region of PGK plays a role in the stability and catalytic mechanism of the enzyme.",PMID: 10092885 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,777: J Biol Chem  1999 Apr 2;274(14):9455-62 ,Cef1p is a component of the Prp19p-associated complex and essential for pre-mRNA splicing.
"The Prp19p protein of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an essential splicing factor and is associated with the spliceosome during the splicing reaction. We have previously shown that Prp19p is not tightly associated with small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles but is associated with a protein complex consisting of at least eight protein components. By sequencing components of the affinity-purified complex, we have identified Cef1p as a component of the Prp19p-associated complex, Ntc85p. Cef1p could directly interact with Prp19p and was required for pre-mRNA splicing both in vivo and in vitro. The c-Myb DNA binding motif at the amino terminus of Cef1p was required for cellular growth but not for interaction of Cef1p with Prp19p or Cef1p self-interaction. We have identified a small region of 30 amino acid residues near the carboxyl terminus required for both cell viability and protein-protein interactions. Cef1p was associated with the spliceosome in the same manner as Prp19p, i.e. concomitant with or immediately after dissociation of U4. The anti-Cef1p antibody inhibited binding to the spliceosome of Cef1p, Prp19p, and at least three other components of the Prp19p-associated complex, suggesting that the Prp19p-associated complex is likely associated with the spliceosome and functions as an integral complex.",PMID: 10092627 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,778: J Gen Virol  1999 Mar;80 ( Pt 3):607-15 ,A cellular protein which binds hepatitis B virus but not hepatitis B surface antigen.
"The envelope of hepatitis B virus (HBV) consists of three related proteins known as the large (L), middle (M) and small (S) hepatitis B surface antigens (HBsAg). L-HBsAg has a 108-119 amino acid extension at the N terminus compared with M-HBsAg and contains the preS1 sequence of the HBV envelope. Previous research has identified this region as the likely virus attachment protein which is thought to interact with the cellular receptor for the virus. However, as the receptor has still not been identified unequivocally, we used the preS1 region of L-HBsAg to screen a human liver cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid system. Several positive clones were isolated which encoded cellular proteins that interacted with the HBV preS1 protein. The specificity was examined in an independent manner in experiments in which baculovirus-derived glutathione S-transferase (GST)-preS1 was incubated with 35S-labelled protein expressed by in vitro translation from the positive clones. The intensity of the interactions using this alternative approach mirrored those observed in the yeast two-hybrid system and two proteins (an unidentified protein and a mitochondrial protein) were selected for further study. The specificity of the binding reaction between the preS1 protein and these two proteins was further confirmed in a competition assay; HBV purified from serum, but not purified HBsAg, was able to compete with preS1 and thus block GST-preS1 binding to the unidentified protein but not to the mitochondrial protein. The unidentified protein was then expressed as a fusion protein with GST and this was able to bind HBV virions in a direct manner.",PMID: 10091999 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,779: Genes Dev  1999 Mar 15;13(6):686-97 ,Characterization of the imitation switch subfamily of ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling factors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
"We have identified and characterized two Imitation Switch genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ISW1 and ISW2, which are highly related to Drosophila ISWI, encoding the putative ATPase subunit of three ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors. Purification of ISW1p reveals a four-subunit complex with nucleosome-stimulated ATPase activity, as well as ATP-dependent nucleosome disruption and spacing activities. Purification of ISW2p reveals a two-subunit complex also with nucleosome-stimulated ATPase and ATP-dependent nucleosome spacing activities but no detectable nucleosome disruption activity. Null mutations of ISW1, ISW2, and CHD1 genes cause synthetic lethality in various stress conditions in yeast cells, revealing the first in vivo functions of the ISWI subfamily of chromatin-remodeling complexes and demonstrating their genetic interactions. A single point mutation within the ATPase domain of both ISW1p and ISW2p inactivated all ATP-dependent biochemical activities of the complexes, as well as the ability of the genes to rescue the mutant phenotypes. This demonstrates that the ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling activities are essential for the in vivo functions of both ISW1 and ISW2 complexes.",PMID: 10090725 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,780: J Cell Biol  1999 Mar 22;144(6):1187-202 ,A Cdc24p-Far1p-Gbetagamma protein complex required for yeast orientation during mating.
"Oriented cell growth requires the specification of a site for polarized growth and subsequent orientation of the cytoskeleton towards this site. During mating, haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells orient their growth in response to a pheromone gradient overriding an internal landmark for polarized growth, the bud site. This response requires Cdc24p, Far1p, and a heterotrimeric G-protein. Here we show that a two- hybrid interaction between Cdc24p and Gbeta requires Far1p but not pheromone-dependent MAP-kinase signaling, indicating Far1p has a role in regulating the association of Cdc24p and Gbeta. Binding experiments demonstrate that Cdc24p, Far1p, and Gbeta form a complex in which pairwise interactions can occur in the absence of the third protein. Cdc24p localizes to sites of polarized growth suggesting that this complex is localized. In the absence of CDC24-FAR1-mediated chemotropism, a bud site selection protein, Bud1p/Rsr1p, is essential for morphological changes in response to pheromone. These results suggest that formation of a Cdc24p-Far1p-Gbetagamma complex functions as a landmark for orientation of the cytoskeleton during growth towards an external signal.",PMID: 10087263 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,781: J Cell Biol  1999 Mar 8;144(5):963-75 ,"The cortical localization of the microtubule orientation protein, Kar9p, is dependent upon actin and proteins required for polarization."
"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, positioning of the mitotic spindle requires both the cytoplasmic microtubules and actin. Kar9p is a novel cortical protein that is required for the correct position of the mitotic spindle and the orientation of the cytoplasmic microtubules. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)- Kar9p localizes to a single spot at the tip of the growing bud and the mating projection. However, the cortical localization of Kar9p does not require microtubules (Miller, R.K., and M.D. Rose. 1998. J. Cell Biol. 140: 377), suggesting that Kar9p interacts with other proteins at the cortex. To investigate Kar9p's cortical interactions, we treated cells with the actin-depolymerizing drug, latrunculin-A. In both shmoos and mitotic cells, Kar9p's cortical localization was completely dependent on polymerized actin. Kar9p localization was also altered by mutations in four genes, spa2Delta, pea2Delta, bud6Delta, and bni1Delta, required for normal polarization and actin cytoskeleton functions and, of these, bni1Delta affected Kar9p localization most severely. Like kar9Delta, bni1Delta mutants exhibited nuclear positioning defects during mitosis and in shmoos. Furthermore, like kar9Delta, the bni1Delta mutant exhibited misoriented cytoplasmic microtubules in shmoos. Genetic analysis placed BNI1 in the KAR9 pathway for nuclear migration. However, analysis of kar9Delta bni1Delta double mutants suggested that Kar9p retained some function in bni1Delta mitotic cells. Unlike the polarization mutants, kar9Delta shmoos had a normal morphology and diploids budded in the correct bipolar pattern. Furthermore, Bni1p localized normally in kar9Delta. We conclude that Kar9p's function is specific for cytoplasmic microtubule orientation and that Kar9p's role in nuclear positioning is to coordinate the interactions between the actin and microtubule networks.",PMID: 10085294 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,782: J Cell Biol  1999 Mar 8;144(5):947-61 ,Control of mitotic spindle position by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae formin Bni1p.
"Alignment of the mitotic spindle with the axis of cell division is an essential process in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that is mediated by interactions between cytoplasmic microtubules and the cell cortex. We found that a cortical protein, the yeast formin Bni1p, was required for spindle orientation. Two striking abnormalities were observed in bni1Delta cells. First, the initial movement of the spindle pole body (SPB) toward the emerging bud was defective. This phenotype is similar to that previously observed in cells lacking the kinesin Kip3p and, in fact, BNI1 and KIP3 were found to be in the same genetic pathway. Second, abnormal pulling interactions between microtubules and the cortex appeared to cause preanaphase spindles in bni1Delta cells to transit back and forth between the mother and the bud. We therefore propose that Bni1p may localize or alter the function of cortical microtubule-binding sites in the bud. Additionally, we present evidence that other bipolar bud site determinants together with cortical actin are also required for spindle orientation.",PMID: 10085293 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,783: Mol Cell Biol  1999 Apr;19(4):2967-76 ,An activator binding module of yeast RNA polymerase II holoenzyme.
"The Mediator complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is required for both general and regulated transcription of RNA polymerase II (PolII) and is composed of two stable subcomplexes (Srb4 and Rgr1 subcomplexes). To decipher the function of each Mediator subcomplex and to delineate the functional relationship between the subcomplexes, we characterized the compositions and biochemical activities of PolII-Mediator complexes (holoenzymes) prepared from several Mediator mutant strains of S. cerevisiae. We found that holoenzymes devoid of a functional Gal11 module were defective for activated but not basal transcription in a reconstituted in vitro system. This activation-specific defect was correlated with a crippled physical interaction to transcriptional activator proteins, which could be bypassed by artificial recruitment of a mutant holoenzyme to a promoter. Consistent with this observation, a direct interaction between Gal11 and gene-specific transcriptional activator proteins was detected by far-Western analyses and column binding assays. In contrast, the srb5 deletion mutant holoenzyme was defective for both basal and activated transcription, despite its capacity for activator binding that is comparable to that of the wild-type holoenzyme. These results demonstrate that the Gal11 module of the Rgr1 subcomplex is required for the efficient recruitment of PolII holoenzyme to a promoter via activator-specific interactions, while the Srb4 subcomplex functions in the modulation of general polymerase activity.",PMID: 10082564 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,784: Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A  1999 Mar 16;96(6):2656-61 ,The fission yeast homologue of Orc4p binds to replication origin DNA via multiple AT-hooks.

Although ORC appears to play an essential role in the initiation of DNA replication in the cells of all eukaryotes, its interactions with DNA have not been defined in species other than budding yeast. We have characterized a Schizosaccharomyces pombe homologue of the ORC subunit, Orc4p. The homologue (Orp4p) consists of two distinct functional domains. The C-terminal domain shows strong sequence similarity to human, frog, and yeast Orc4 proteins, including conserved ATP-binding motifs. The N-terminal domain contains nine copies of the AT-hook motif found in a number of DNA-binding proteins, including the members of the HMG-I(Y) family of chromatin proteins. AT-hook motifs are known from biochemical and structural studies to mediate binding to the minor groove of AT-tracts in DNA. Orp4p is essential for viability of Sc. pombe and is expressed throughout the cell cycle. The Orp4 protein (and its isolated N-terminal domain) binds to the Sc. pombe replication origin, ars1. The DNA binding properties of Orp4p provide a plausible explanation for the characteristic features of Sc. pombe origins of replication, which differ significantly from those of Sa. cerevisiae.",PMID: 10077566 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,785: EMBO J  1999 Mar 15;18(6):1621-9 ,A trans-acting peptide activates the yeast a1 repressor by raising its DNA-binding affinity.
"The cooperative binding of gene regulatory proteins to DNA is a common feature of transcriptional control in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It is generally viewed as a simple energy coupling, through protein-protein interactions, of two or more DNA-binding proteins. In this paper, we show that the simple view does not account for the cooperative DNA binding of a1 and alpha2, two homeodomain proteins from budding yeast. Rather, we show through the use of chimeric proteins and synthetic peptides that, upon heterodimerization, alpha2 instructs a1 to bind DNA. This change is induced by contact with a peptide contributed by alpha2, and this contact converts a1 from a weak to a strong DNA-binding protein. This explains, in part, how high DNA-binding specificity is achieved only when the two gene regulatory proteins conjoin. We also provide evidence that features of the a1-alpha2 interaction can serve as a model for other examples of protein-protein interactions, including that between the herpes virus transcriptional activator VP16 and the mammalian homeodomain-containing protein Oct-l.",PMID: 10075932 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,786: Biotechnol Appl Biochem  1999 Apr;29 ( Pt 2):165-84 ,Mutational analysis of sickle haemoglobin (Hb) gelation.
"The use of recombinant Hb has provided the advantage that any amino acid substitution can be made at sites not represented by natural mutants or that cannot be modified by chemical procedures. We have recently reported the expression of human sickle Hb (HbS) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that carries a plasmid containing the human alpha- and beta-globin cDNA sequences; N-terminal nascent protein processing is correct and a soluble correctly folded Hb tetramer is produced. The yeast system produces a recombinant sickle Hb that is identical by about a dozen biochemical and physiological criteria with the natural sickle Hb purified from the red cells of sickle-cell anaemia patients. Most importantly, the gelling concentration of this recombinant sickle Hb is the same as that of the HbS purified from human sickle red cells. The misfolding of Hb reported for the Escherichia coli-expressed protein is not apparent for Hb expressed in yeast by any of the criteria that we have used for characterization. These findings indicate that this system is well suited to the production of HbS mutants to explore those areas of the HbS tetramer whose roles in the gelation process are not yet defined and to measure quantitatively the strength of such interactions at certain inter-tetrameric contact sites in the deoxy-HbS aggregate.

"mRNA decay is a multistep process, often dependent on the active translation of an mRNA and on components of the translation apparatus. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, several trans-acting factors required for mRNA decay associate with polyribosomes. We have explored the specificity of the interactions of these factors with polyribosomes, using sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis of the yeast UPF1 protein to test whether such interactions are altered when polyribosomes are disrupted by treatment with EDTA, digestion with micrococcal nuclease, or shifting of cells containing a temperature-sensitive eIF3 mutation to the nonpermissive temperature. These experiments, as well as others assaying the strength of factor association in high-salt sucrose gradients, lead us to conclude that Upf1p is tightly bound to the smallest polyribosomes, but not to the 40S or 60S ribosomal subunits. Similar experimental approaches were used to determine whether mRNA decay initiates prior to mRNA release from polyribosomes. Using sucrose gradient fractionation and Northern blotting, we can detect the polysomal association of a PGK1 mRNA decay intermediate and conclude that mRNA decay commences while an mRNA is still being translated.

"Brome mosaic virus (BMV), a positive-strand RNA virus in the alphavirus-like superfamily, encodes two RNA replication proteins. The 1a protein has putative helicase and RNA-capping domains, whereas 2a contains a polymerase-like domain. Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing 1a and 2a is capable of replicating a BMV RNA3 template produced by in vivo transcription of a DNA copy of RNA3. Although insufficient for RNA3 replication, the expression of 1a protein alone results in a dramatic and specific stabilization of the RNA3 template in yeast. As one step toward understanding 1a-induced stabilization of RNA3, the interactions involved, and its possible relation to RNA replication, we have identified the cis-acting sequences required for this effect. We find that 1a-induced stabilization is mediated by a 150- to 190-base segment of the RNA3 intergenic region corresponding to a previously identified enhancer of RNA3 replication. Moreover, this segment is sufficient to confer 1a-induced stability on a heterologous beta-globin RNA. Within this intergenic segment, partial deletions that inhibited 1a-induced stabilization in yeast expressing 1a alone resulted in parallel decreases in the levels of negative- and positive-strand RNA3 replication products in yeast expressing 1a and 2a. In particular, a small deletion encompassing a motif corresponding to the box B element of RNA polymerase III promoters dramatically reduced the ability of RNAs to respond to 1a or 1a and 2a. These and other findings suggest that 1a-induced stabilization likely reflects an early template selection step in BMV RNA replication.",PMID: 10074107 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,789: Genes Dev  1999 Mar 1;13(5):569-80 ,Interaction of the U1 snRNP with nonconserved intronic sequences affects 5' splice site selection.
"Intron definition and splice site selection occur at an early stage during assembly of the spliceosome, the complex mediating pre-mRNA splicing. Association of U1 snRNP with the pre-mRNA is required for these early steps. We report here that the yeast U1 snRNP-specific protein Nam8p is a component of the commitment complexes, the first stable complexes assembled on pre-mRNA. In vitro and in vivo, Nam8p becomes indispensable for efficient 5' splice site recognition when this process is impaired as a result of the presence of noncanonical 5' splice sites or the absence of a cap structure. Nam8p stabilizes commitment complexes in the latter conditions. Consistent with this, Nam8p interacts with the pre-mRNA downstream of the 5' splice site, in a region of nonconserved sequence. Substitutions in this region affect splicing efficiency and alternative splice site choice in a Nam8p-dependent manner. Therefore, Nam8p is involved in a novel mechanism by which a snRNP component can affect splice site choice and regulate intron removal through its interaction with a nonconserved sequence. This supports a model where early 5' splice recognition results from a network of interactions established by the splicing machinery with various regions of the pre-mRNA.",PMID: 10072385 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,790: Genes Dev  1999 Mar 1;13(5):545-55 ,Regulation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae kinetochores by the type 1 phosphatase Glc7p.
"We have investigated the role of protein phosphorylation in regulation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae kinetochores. By use of phosphatase inhibitors and a type 1 protein phosphatase mutant (glc7-10), we show that the microtubule binding activity, but not the centromeric DNA-binding activity, of the kinetochore complex is regulated by a balance between a protein kinase and the type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1) encoded by the GLC7 gene. glc7-10 mutant cells exhibit low kinetochore-microtubule binding activity in vitro and a high frequency of chromosome loss in vivo. Specifically, the Ndc10p component of the centromere DNA-binding CBF3 complex is altered by the glc7-10 mutation; Ndc10p is hyperphosphorylated in glc7-10 extracts. Furthermore, addition of recombinant Ndc10p reconstitutes the microtubule-binding activity of a glc7-10 extract to wild-type levels. Finally, the glc7-10-induced mitotic arrest is abolished in spindle checkpoint mutants, suggesting that defects in kinetochore-microtubule interactions caused by hyperphosphorylation of kinetochore proteins activate the spindle checkpoint.",PMID: 10072383 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,791: Mol Gen Genet  1999 Feb;261(1):80-91 ,Functional implications of genetic interactions between genes encoding small GTPases involved in vesicular transport in yeast.
"Ras-related, guanine nucleotide-binding proteins of the Ypt/Rab family play a key role at defined steps in vesicular transport, both in yeast and in mammalian cells. In yeast, Ypt1p has an essential function late in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi transport, and the redundant Ypt31/Ypt32 GTPases have been proposed to act in transport through and/or from the Golgi. Here we report that mutant alleles of YPT31 and YPT32, whose gene products have a reduced affinity for GTP, are able to suppress the dominant lethal phenotype of YPT1(N121I). Co-expression of YPT1(N121I) and the suppressor YPT31(N126I) allow essentially undisturbed secretory transport in the absence of the respective wild-type GTPases. Such mutant cells massively overaccumulate 60-100 nm vesicles and are heat sensitive. It appears likely that the mutant GTPases, which are defective in nucleotide binding, compete for the binding of common interacting protein(s).

"During mating of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two nuclei fuse to produce a single diploid nucleus. Two genes, KAR7 and KAR8, were previously identified by mutations that cause defects in nuclear membrane fusion. KAR7 is allelic to SEC71, a gene involved in protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum. Two other translocation mutants, sec63-1 and sec72Delta, also exhibited moderate karyogamy defects. Membranes from kar7/sec71Delta and sec72Delta, but not sec63-1, exhibited reduced membrane fusion in vitro, but only at elevated temperatures. Genetic interactions between kar7 and kar5 mutations were suggestive of protein-protein interactions. Moreover, in sec71 mutants, Kar5p was absent from the SPB and was not detected by Western blot or immunoprecipitation of pulse-labeled protein. KAR8 is allelic to JEMI, encoding an endoplasmic reticulum resident DnaJ protein required for nuclear fusion. Overexpression of KAR8/JEM1 (but not SEC63) strongly suppressed the mating defect of kar2-1, suggesting that Kar2p interacts with Kar8/Jem1p for nuclear fusion. Electron microscopy analysis of kar8 mutant zygotes revealed a nuclear fusion defect different from kar2, kar5, and kar7/sec71 mutants. Analysis of double mutants suggested that Kar5p acts before Kar8/Jem1p.

"Cdc42p is an essential GTPase that belongs to the Rho/Rac subfamily of Ras-like GTPases. These proteins act as molecular switches by responding to exogenous and/or endogenous signals and relaying those signals to activate downstream components of a biological pathway. The 11 current members of the Cdc42p family display between 75 and 100% amino acid identity and are functional as well as structural homologs. Cdc42p transduces signals to the actin cytoskeleton to initiate and maintain polarized gorwth and to mitogen-activated protein morphogenesis. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cdc42p plays an important role in multiple actin-dependent morphogenetic events such as bud emergence, mating-projection formation, and pseudohyphal growth. In mammalian cells, Cdc42p regulates a variety of actin-dependent events and induces the JNK/SAPK protein kinase cascade, which leads to the activation of transcription factors within the nucleus. Cdc42p mediates these processes through interactions with a myriad of downstream effectors, whose number and regulation we are just starting to understand. In addition, Cdc42p has been implicated in a number of human diseases through interactions with its regulators and downstream effectors. While much is known about Cdc42p structure and functional interactions, little is known about the mechanism(s) by which it transduces signals within the cell. Future research should focus on this question as well as on the detailed analysis of the interactions of Cdc42p with its regulators and downstream effectors.","Publication Types: Review Review, Tutorial",PMID: 10066831 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,794: J Biol Chem  1999 Mar 12;274(11):7576-82

Similarly, several hect domain proteins, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae RSP5, form ubiquitin thioester complexes, indicating that hect domain proteins in general have E3 activity. We show here, by the use of chimeric E2s generated between UbcH5 and other E2s, that a region of UbcH5 encompassing the catalytic site cysteine residue is critical for its ability to interact with E6-AP and RSP5. Of particular importance is a phenylalanine residue at position 62 of UbcH5 that is conserved among the members of the UBC4/UBC5 subfamily but is not present in any of the other known E2s, whereas the N-terminal 60 amino acids do not contribute significantly to the specificity of these interactions.

For long genomic segments from E. coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Vaccinia virus, Chargaff differences for the W bases and/or for the S bases correlate with transcription direction and gene location. For W-rich genomes, the mRNA-synonymous strand contains regions which, if extruded from negatively supercoiled DNA, would fold to generate stem-loop structures with A-rich loops. Similarly, for S-rich genomes the loops would be G-rich. We suggest that the disposition of genes in nucleic acid sequences arises from their having to adapt to a preexisting mosaic of genomic regions, each distinguished by its potential to extrude single-strand loops enriched for a particular base (or two non-Watson-Crick pairing bases). The mosaic would have facilitated the intrastrand and interstrand accounting required for correction of mutations, and would have evolved in the early RNA world before the emergence of protein-encoding capacity. The preexisting mosaic would have determined transcription direction since there is pressure for all mRNAs of a cell to have purine-rich loops, thus decreasing loop-loop interactions which might lead to formation of ""self"" sense-antisense RNA duplexes.

To date, studies on S. cerevisiae cell-cell and cell-solid support interactions concerned only cell agglutination during mating and flocculation. Colony formation has not been studied before probably because this species is not pathogenic. However, S. cerevisiae can be a convenient model to study this process, thanks to well-developed genetics and the full knowledge of its nucleotide sequence. A preliminary characterization of the recently cloned essential IRR1 gene indicated that it may participate in cell-cell/substrate interactions. Here we show that lowering the level of expression of IRR1 (after fusion with a regulatory catalase A gene promoter) affects colony formation and disturbs zygote formation and spore germination. All these processes involve cell-cell or cell-solid support contacts. The IRR1 protein is localized in the cytosol as verified by immunofluorescence microscopy, and confirmed by cell fractionation and Western blotting. This indicates that Irr1p is not directly involved in the cell-solid support adhesion, but may be an element of a communication pathway between the cell and its surroundings.",PMID: 10028182 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

Phytoestrogens have been investigated in a similar manner. A synergistic effect could not be confirmed for both, xenoestrogens and phytoestrogens.

The chemotactic factors differed for the PMN and J774 cells, however, in terms of heat stability, kinetics of liberation by the yeast cells, and divalent cation requirements for production. The chemoattractant in Candida albicans culture filtrates appeared to act through the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) of PMNs, since it was found to induce chemotaxis of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that were expressing the human FPR but did not induce chemotaxis of wild-type CHO cells. The C. albicans culture filtrates also induced migration of PMNs across confluent monolayers of a human gastrointestinal epithelial cell line, T84; migration occurred in the basolateral-to-apical direction but not the reverse direction, unless the epithelial tight junctions were disrupted. J774 cells did not migrate toward the formylated peptide (fMet-Leu-Phe; fMLF), and chemotaxis toward the C. albicans culture filtrate was not inhibited by an FPR antagonist (t-butoxycarbonyl-Met-Leu-Phe), suggesting that a different receptor mediated J774 cell chemotaxis. In conclusion, we have identified a receptor by which a non-serum-dependent chemotactic factor (NSCF) produced by C. albicans induced chemotaxis of PMNs. Additionally, we have shown that NSCF was active across epithelial monolayers. These findings suggest that NSCFs produced by C. albicans and other yeast species may influence host-pathogen interactions at the gastrointestinal tract mucosal surface by inducing phagocytic-cell infiltration."

In the present study, various N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of Ure2p were constructed and their cross-interactions were tested in vitro and in vivo using affinity binding and a two-hybrid analysis.

The N- and C-termini of Fn each contain one non-covalent fibrin-binding site, which are composed of type 1 (F1) structural repeats. We have previously localized the N-terminal site to the fourth and fifth F1 repeats (4F1.5F1). In the current studies, using proteolytic and recombinant proteins representing both the N- and C-terminal fibrin-binding regions, we localized and characterized the C-terminal fibrin-binding site, compared the relative fibrin-binding activities of both sites and determined the contribution of each site to the fibrin-binding activity of intact Fn. By fibrin-affinity chromatography, a protein composed of the 10F1 repeat through to the C-terminus of Fn (10F1-COOH), expressed in COS-1 cells, and 10F1-12F1, produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, displayed fibrin-binding activity. However, since 10F1 and 10F1.11F1 were not active, the presence of 12F1 is required for fibrin binding. A proteolytic fragment of 14.4 kDa, beginning 14 residues N-terminal to 10F1, was isolated from the fibrin-affinity matrix. Radio-iodinated 14.4 kDa fibrin-binding peptide/protein (FBP) demonstrated a dose-dependent and saturable binding to fibrin-coated wells that was both competitively inhibited and reversed by unlabelled 14.4 kDa FBP. Comparison of the fibrin-binding affinities of proteolytic FBPs from the N-terminus (25.9 kDa FBP), the C-terminus (14.4 kDa) and intact Fn by ELISA yielded estimated Kd values of 216, 18 and 2.1 nM, respectively. The higher fibrin-binding affinity of the N-terminus was substantiated by the ability of both a recombinant 4F1.5F1 and a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to this site to maximally inhibit biotinylated Fn binding to fibrin by 80%, and by blocking the 90% inhibitory activity of a polyclonal anti-Fn, by absorption with the 25.9 kDa FBP. We propose that whereas the N-terminal site appears to contribute to most of the binding activity of native Fn to fibrin, the specific binding of the C-terminal site may strengthen this interaction."

This paper describes the development and application of this strategy to the one-chromatographic step affinity purification of NAD(P)+-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases using 8'-azo-linked immobilized NAD(P)+, S6-linked and N6-linked immobilized NAD+, and N6-linked immobilized NADP+ derivatives. These studies were carried out using alcohol dehydrogenases from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (YADH, EC 1.1.1.1), equine liver (HLADH, EC 1.1.1.1), and Thermoanaerobium brockii (TBADH, EC 1.1.1.2). The results reveal that the factors which require careful consideration before development of a truly biospecific system based on the locking-on strategy include: (i) the stability of the immobilized cofactor derivative; (ii) the spacer-arm composition of the affinity derivative; (iii) the accessible immobilized cofactor concentration; (iv) the soluble locking-on ligand concentration; (v) the dissociation constant of locking-on ligand, and (vi) the identification and elimination of nonbiospecific interference. The S6-linked immobilized NAD+ derivative (synthesized with a hydrophilic spacer arm) proved to be the most suitable of the affinity adsorbents investigated in the present study for use with the locking-on strategy. This conclusion was based primarily on the observations that this affinity adsorbent was stable, retained cofactor activity with the ""test"" enzymes under study, and was not prone to nonbiospecific interactions. Using this immobilized derivative in conjunction with the locking-on strategy, alcohol dehydrogenase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity in a single affinity chromatographic step.

In this study, potential interactions of BPAG2 with other proteins expressed in epidermal keratinocytes were explored by yeast two-hybrid system using the amino-terminal intracellular domain of BPAG2 as a bait. Several independent interacting clones encoding keratin 18 (K18) were identified when the keratinocyte cDNA library, cloned into the yeast two-hybrid activation domain vector, was screened. The peptide sequence responsible for the interaction of BPAG2 was restricted to amino acids 15-25, and substitution of a valine residue in the middle of this sequence by a proline (V23P) by site-directed mutagenesis abolished the interaction. Further examination of the K18 sequences by restricted cDNA constructs in yeast two-hybrid system identified a carboxyl-terminal segment corresponding to helix 2B domain as critical for BPAG2 binding. The interaction of BPAG2/K18 was confirmed by an in vitro protein-protein interaction assay, which also confirmed that normal human keratinocytes express K18 in culture. The tissue specific expression of BPAG2 was first examined using a multi-tissue RNA blot. Human multiple tissue cDNA panels representing a variety of adult and fetal tissues as well as tumor cells were used as PCR-templates to study the expression patterns of both BPAG2 and K18. The results demonstrated significant level of expression of BPAG2, besides in epidermal keratinocytes, also in a variety of tissues with predominant epithelial component, such as mammary, salivary and thyroid glands, colon, prostate, testis, placenta, and adult and fetal thymus, as well as in colon, pancreatic and prostatic adenocarcinoma cell lines, and an ovarian carcinoma. As expected, K18 transcript is present in liver, pancreas, colon, placenta, and in fetal kidney. Collectively, the results suggest that BPAG2 has a relatively broad tissue distribution including specialized and simple epithelia, and that within the tissues such as colon and placenta, BPAG2 may have direct interactions with K18, a keratin characteristically expressed in a simple epithelia."

In contrast to vertebrate UsnRNAs, S. cerevisiae UsnRNAs contain only a few Psi residues, which are located in segments involved in intermolecular RNA-RNA or RNA-protein interactions. At these positions, UsnRNAs are universally modified. When yeast mutants disrupted for one of the several pseudouridine synthase genes (PUS1, PUS2, PUS3, and PUS4) or depleted in rRNA-pseudouridine synthase Cbf5p were tested for UsnRNA Psi content, only the loss of the Pus1p activity was found to affect Psi formation in spliceosomal UsnRNAs. Indeed, Psi44 formation in U2 snRNA was abolished. By using purified Pus1p enzyme and in vitro-produced U2 snRNA, Pus1p is shown here to catalyze Psi44 formation in the S. cerevisiae U2 snRNA. Thus, Pus1p is the first UsnRNA pseudouridine synthase characterized so far which exhibits a dual substrate specificity, acting on both tRNAs and U2 snRNA. As depletion of rRNA-pseudouridine synthase Cbf5p had no effect on UsnRNA Psi content, formation of Psi residues in S. cerevisiae UsnRNAs is not dependent on the Cbf5p-snoRNA guided mechanism."

"The yeast protein Set1p, inactivation of which alleviates telomeric position effect (TPE), contains a conserved SET domain present in chromosomal proteins involved in epigenetic control of transcription. Mec3p is required for efficient DNA-damage-dependent checkpoints at G1/S, intra-S and G2/M (refs 3-7). We show here that the SET domain of Set1p interacts with Mec3p. Deletion of SET1 increases the viability of mec3delta mutants after DNA damage (in a process that is mostly independent of Rad53p kinase, which has a central role in checkpoint control) but does not significantly affect cell-cycle progression. Deletion of MEC3 enhances TPE and attenuates the Set1delta-induced silencing defect. Furthermore, restoration of TPE in a Set1delta mutant by overexpression of the isolated SET domain requires Mec3p. Finally, deletion of MEC3 results in telomere elongation, whereas cells with deletions of both SET1 and MEC3 do not have elongated telomeres.

"Integral membrane proteins associated with the nuclear pore complex (NPC) are likely to play an important role in the biogenesis of this structure. Here we have examined the functional roles of domains of the yeast pore membrane protein Pom152p in establishing its topology and its interactions with other NPC proteins. The topology of Pom152p was evaluated by alkaline extraction, protease protection, and endoglycosidase H sensitivity assays. The results of these experiments suggest that Pom152p contains a single transmembrane segment with its N terminus (amino acid residues 1-175) extending into the nuclear pore and its C terminus (amino acid residues 196-1337) positioned in the lumen of the nuclear envelope. The functional role of these different domains was investigated in mutants that are dependent on Pom152p for viability. The requirement for Pom152p in strains containing mutations allelic to the NPC protein genes NIC96 and NUP59 could be alleviated by Pom152p's N terminus, independent of its integration into the membrane. However, complementation of a mutation in NUP170 required both the N terminus and the transmembrane segment. Furthermore, mutations in NUP188 were rescued only by full-length Pom152p, suggesting that the lumenal structures play an important role in the function of pore-side NPC structures.",PMID: 9988776 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,822: Mol Endocrinol  1999 Feb;13(2):286-96 ,Estrogen receptor domains E and F: role in dimerization and interaction with coactivator RIP-140.
"We have used the yeast two-hybrid system to localize the ligand-dependent dimerization domain of the estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) to region E in vivo. In this system, the cDNAs corresponding to the A-D, E, E/F, A-E (deltaF), and full-length (wtER) domains of the human ER were each cloned into the yeast two-hybrid vectors GAL4 DB and GAL4 TA and expressed in different combinations in yeast harboring a GAL1-lacZ reporter. The reporter was used as a relative measure of the interaction between the ER domains, through reconstitution of GAL4 activity. We found that the interaction of E or E/F domains of the ER with full-length ER is estradiol dependent and estrogen responsive element independent, as measured by the reconstitution of GAL4 activity from GAL4-E domain-containing fusion protein interactions. In the presence of F domain, this activity is reduced 10-fold. The results suggest that sequences in the F domain are inhibitory to the dimerization signal that is present in the E region. We propose that the full-length ER contains intrinsic dimerization restraints contributed by regions outside domain E that are released upon binding hormone agonist. In addition, we have demonstrated that coactivator RIP140 is able to interact with the ER in vivo at the E domain of the receptor in the presence of estrogen. Yeast two-hybrid analysis shows that RIP140 does not homodimerize in the presence or absence of estrogens. We present evidence showing that the ER has the inherent ability to interact with RIP140 in the presence of antiestrogens, but sequences inherent in the ER itself that are present outside of the E domain compromise this ability.",PMID: 9973258 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,823: Mol Biol Cell  1999 Feb;10(2):329-44 ,Detection of transient in vivo interactions between substrate and transporter during protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum.
"The split-ubiquitin technique was used to detect transient protein interactions in living cells. Nub, the N-terminal half of ubiquitin (Ub), was fused to Sec62p, a component of the protein translocation machinery in the endoplasmic reticulum of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cub, the C-terminal half of Ub, was fused to the C terminus of a signal sequence. The reconstitution of a quasi-native Ub structure from the two halves of Ub, and the resulting cleavage by Ub-specific proteases at the C terminus of Cub, serve as a gauge of proximity between the two test proteins linked to Nub and Cub. Using this assay, we show that Sec62p is spatially close to the signal sequence of the prepro-alpha-factor in vivo. This proximity is confined to the nascent polypeptide chain immediately following the signal sequence. In addition, the extent of proximity depends on the nature of the signal sequence. Cub fusions that bore the signal sequence of invertase resulted in a much lower Ub reconstitution with Nub-Sec62p than otherwise identical test proteins bearing the signal sequence of prepro-alpha-factor. An inactive derivative of Sec62p failed to interact with signal sequences in this assay. These in vivo findings are consistent with Sec62p being part of a signal sequence-binding complex.",PMID: 9950680 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,824: Mol Biol Cell  1999 Feb;10(2):283-96 ,The multiple roles of Cyk1p in the assembly and function of the actomyosin ring in budding yeast.
"The budding yeast IQGAP-like protein Cyk1p/Iqg1p localizes to the mother-bud junction during anaphase and has been shown to be required for the completion of cytokinesis. In this study, video microscopy analysis of cells expressing green fluorescent protein-tagged Cyk1p/Iqg1p demonstrates that Cyk1p/Iqg1p is a dynamic component of the contractile ring during cytokinesis. Furthermore, in the absence of Cyk1p/Iqg1p, myosin II fails to undergo the contraction-like size change at the end of mitosis. To understand the mechanistic role of Cyk1p/Iqg1p in actomyosin ring assembly and dynamics, we have investigated the role of the structural domains that Cyk1p/Iqg1p shares with IQGAPs. An amino terminal portion containing the calponin homology domain binds to actin filaments and is required for the assembly of actin filaments to the ring. This result supports the hypothesis that Cyk1p/Iqg1p plays a direct role in F-actin recruitment. Deletion of the domain harboring the eight IQ motifs abolishes the localization of Cyk1p/Iqg1p to the bud neck, suggesting that Cyk1p/Iqg1p may be localized through interactions with a calmodulin-like protein. Interestingly, deletion of the COOH-terminal GTPase-activating protein-related domain does not affect Cyk1p/Iqg1p localization or actin recruitment to the ring but prevents actomyosin ring contraction. In vitro binding experiments show that Cyk1p/Iqg1p binds to calmodulin, Cmd1p, in a calcium-dependent manner, and to Tem1p, a small GTP-binding protein previously found to be required for the completion of anaphase. These results demonstrate the critical function of Cyk1p/Iqg1p in regulating various steps of actomyosin ring assembly and cytokinesis.",PMID: 9950677 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,825: J Biol Chem  1999 Feb 12;274(7):4027-35 ,Regulation of exocytosis by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 via phosphorylation of Munc18.
"Munc18a, a mammalian neuronal homologue of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sec1p protein, is essential for secretion, likely as a result of its high affinity interaction with the target SNARE protein syntaxin 1a (where SNARE is derived from SNAP receptor (the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein)). However, this interaction inhibits vesicle SNARE interactions with syntaxin that are required for secretory vesicles to achieve competency for membrane fusion. As such, regulation of the interaction between Munc18a and syntaxin 1a may provide an important mechanism controlling secretory responsiveness. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), a member of the Cdc2 family of cell division kinases, co-purifies with Munc18a from rat brain, interacts directly with Munc18a in vitro, and utilizes Munc18a as a substrate for phosphorylation. We have now demonstrated that Cdk5 is capable of phosphorylating Munc18a in vitro within a preformed Munc18a.syntaxin 1a heterodimer complex and that this results in the disassembly of the complex. Using site-directed mutagenesis, the Cdk5 phosphorylation site on Munc18a was identified as Thr574. Stimulation of secretion from neuroendocrine cells produced a corresponding rapid translocation of cytosolic Cdk5 to a particulate fraction and an increase of Cdk5 kinase activity. Inhibition of Cdk5 with olomoucine decreased evoked norepinephrine secretion from chromaffin cells, an effect not observed with the inactive analogue iso-olomoucine. The effects of olomoucine were independent of calcium influx as evidenced by secretory inhibition in permeabilized chromaffin cells and in cells under whole-cell voltage clamp. Furthermore, transfection and expression in chromaffin cells of a neural specific Cdk5 activator, p25, led to a strong increase in nicotinic agonist-induced secretory responses. Our data suggest a model whereby Cdk5 acts to regulate Munc18a interaction with syntaxin 1a and thereby modulates the level of vesicle SNARE interaction with syntaxin 1a and secretory responsiveness.",PMID: 9933594 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,826: Gene  1998 Dec 28;225(1-2):107-16 ,Isolation of hMRE11B: failure to complement yeast mre11 defects due to species-specific protein interactions.
"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae MRE11 gene plays an important role in meiotic recombination, mitotic DNA repair and telomere maintenance. We present the isolation of hMRE11B cDNA from a human HeLa cell cDNA library as an MRE11 homolog. Compared to the previously identified hMRE11, hMRE11B contains an additional 84bp sequence that results in a 28 amino-acid insertion close to the C-terminus. The expression pattern of hMRE11B in different tissues shows the presence of two mRNA species of approx. 2.6 and 7.5kb. Overexpression of hMRE11B does not complement the alkylation sensitivity of the mre11 null and temperature-sensitive mutant strains. In this study, we examine factors that may explain this lack of complementation. First, both Northern and Western analyses rule out the lack of hMRE11B transcription and/or translation in yeast. Second, we demonstrate that hMre11B, like the yeast Mre11 protein, dimerizes in vivo in a yeast two-hybrid system. This dimerization requires the C-terminal one-third of hMre11B protein, which includes the 28 amino acids absent in hMre11. However, hMre11B does not interact with Mre11, Rad50 and Xrs2. Hence, the lack of protein-protein interaction between hMre11B and the yeast Mre11, Rad50, and Xrs2 may explain the inability of hMRE11B to complement the yeast mre11 mutants. We rule out the hypothesis that the lack of interaction and, in turn of complementation, is due to the absence of sequence homology at the C-terminal domain of hMre11B compared to the yeast Mre11. Instead, we propose that the C-terminus of hMre11B participates in protein-protein interaction and functions in a species-specific manner.",PMID: 9931460 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,827: Biochemistry  1999 Jan 26;38(4):1365-70 ,Nonspecific weak actomyosin interactions: relocation of charged residues in subdomain 1 of actin does not alter actomyosin function.
"Yeast actin mutants with relocated charged residues within subdomain 1 were constructed so we could investigate the functional importance of individual clusters of acidic residues in mediating actomyosin weak-binding states in the cross-bridge cycle. Past studies have established a functional role for three distinct pairs of charged residues within this region of yeast actin (D2/E4, D24/D25, and E99/E100); the loss of any one of these pairs resulted in the same impairment in weak actomyosin interaction and in its function. However, the specificity of myosin interaction with these sites has not yet been addressed. To investigate this, we made and analyzed two new actin mutants, 4Ac/D24A/D25A and 4Ac/E99A/E100A. In these mutants, the acidic residues of the D24/D25 or E99/E100 sites were replaced with uncharged residues (alanines) and a pair of acidic residues was inserted at the N-terminus, maintaining the overall charge density of subdomain 1. Using the in vitro motility assays, we found that the sliding and force generation properties of these mutant actins were identical to those of wild-type actin. Similarly, actin-activated ATPase activities of the mutant and wild-type actins were also indistinguishable. Additionally, the binding of S1 to these mutant actins in the presence of ATP was similar to that of wild-type actin. These results show that relocation of charged residues in subdomain 1 of actin does not affect the weak actomyosin interactions and actomyosin function.",PMID: 9930999 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,828: FEBS Lett  1999 Jan 22;443(1):41-7 ,C-terminal domains of human translation termination factors eRF1 and eRF3 mediate their in vivo interaction.
"At the termination step of protein synthesis, hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA is jointly catalysed at the ribosome by the termination codon and the polypeptide release factor (eRF1 in eukaryotes). eRF1 forms in vivo and in vitro a stable complex with release factor eRF3, an eRF1-dependent and ribosome-dependent GTPase. The role of the eRF1-eRF3 complex in translation remains unclear. We have undertaken a systematic analysis of the interactions between the human eRF1 and eRF3 employing a yeast two-hybrid assay. We show that the N-terminal parts of eRF1 (positions 1-280) and of eRF3 (positions 1477) are either not involved or non-essential for binding. Two regions in each factor are critical for mutual binding: positions 478-530 and 628-637 of eRF3 and positions 281-305 and 411-415 of eRF1. The GTP binding domain of eRF3 is not involved in complex formation with eRF1. The GILRY pentamer (positions 411-415) conserved in eukaryotes and archaebacteria is critical for eRF1's ability to stimulate eRF3 GTPase. The human eRF1 lacking 22 C-terminal amino acids remains active as a release factor and promotes an eRF3 GTPase activity whereas C-terminally truncated eRF3 is inactive as a GTPase.",PMID: 9928949 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,829: EMBO J  1999 Feb 1;18(3):754-62 ,Regulation of Hsp90 ATPase activity by tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-domain co-chaperones.
"The in vivo function of the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) molecular chaperone is dependent on the binding and hydrolysis of ATP, and on interactions with a variety of co-chaperones containing tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains. We have now analysed the interaction of the yeast TPR-domain co-chaperones Sti1 and Cpr6 with yeast Hsp90 by isothermal titration calorimetry, circular dichroism spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation, and determined the effect of their binding on the inherent ATPase activity of Hsp90. Sti1 and Cpr6 both bind with sub-micromolar affinity, with Sti1 binding accompanied by a large conformational change. Two co-chaperone molecules bind per Hsp90 dimer, and Sti1 itself is found to be a dimer in free solution. The inherent ATPase activity of Hsp90 is completely inhibited by binding of Sti1, but is not affected by Cpr6, although Cpr6 can reactivate the ATPase activity by displacing Sti1 from Hsp90. Bound Sti1 makes direct contact with, and blocks access to the ATP-binding site in the N-terminal domain of Hsp90. These results reveal an important role for TPR-domain co-chaperones as regulators of the ATPase activity of Hsp90, showing that the ATP-dependent step in Hsp90-mediated protein folding occurs after the binding of the folding client protein, and suggesting that ATP hydrolysis triggers client-protein release.",PMID: 9927435 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,830: EMBO J  1999 Feb 1;18(3):717-26 ,Destruction of Myc by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis: cancer-associated and transforming mutations stabilize Myc.
"The human proto-oncogene c-myc encodes a highly unstable transcription factor that promotes cell proliferation. Although the extreme instability of Myc plays an important role in preventing its accumulation in normal cells, little is known about how Myc is targeted for rapid destruction. Here, we have investigated mechanisms regulating the stability of Myc. We show that Myc is destroyed by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and define two elements in Myc that oppositely regulate its stability: a transcriptional activation domain that promotes Myc destruction, and a region required for association with the POZ domain protein Miz-1 that stabilizes Myc. We also show that Myc is stabilized by cancer-associated and transforming mutations within its transcriptional activation domain. Our data reveal a complex network of interactions regulating Myc destruction, and imply that enhanced protein stability contributes to oncogenic transformation by mutant Myc proteins.",PMID: 9927431 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,831: EMBO J  1999 Feb 1;18(3):632-43 ,Bcl-xL regulates apoptosis by heterodimerization-dependent and -independent mechanisms.
"A hydrophobic cleft formed by the BH1, BH2 and BH3 domains of Bcl-xL is responsible for interactions between Bcl-xL and BH3-containing death agonists. Mutants were constructed which did not bind to Bax but retained anti-apoptotic activity. Since Bcl-xL can form an ion channel in synthetic lipid membranes, the possibility that this property has a role in heterodimerization-independent cell survival was tested by replacing amino acids within the predicted channel-forming domain with the corresponding amino acids from Bax. The resulting chimera showed a reduced ability to adopt an open conductance state over a wide range of membrane potentials. Although this construct retained the ability to heterodimerize with Bax and to inhibit apoptosis, when a mutation was introduced that rendered the chimera incapable of heterodimerization, the resulting protein failed to prevent both apoptosis in mammalian cells and Bax-mediated growth defect in yeast. Similar to mammalian cells undergoing apoptosis, yeast cells expressing Bax exhibited changes in mitochondrial properties that were inhibited by Bcl-xL through heterodimerization-dependent and -independent mechanisms. These data suggest that Bcl-xL regulates cell survival by at least two distinct mechanisms; one is associated with heterodimerization and the other with the ability to form a sustained ion channel.",PMID: 9927423 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,832: EMBO J  1999 Feb 1;18(3):555-64 ,Retrograde transport from the yeast Golgi is mediated by two ARF GAP proteins with overlapping function.
"ARF proteins, which mediate vesicular transport, have little or no intrinsic GTPase activity. They rely on the actions of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for their function. The in vitro GTPase activity of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ARF proteins Arf1 and Arf2 is stimulated by the yeast Gcs1 protein, and in vivo genetic interactions between arf and gcs1 mutations implicate Gcs1 in vesicular transport. However, the Gcs1 protein is dispensable, indicating that additional ARF GAP proteins exist. We show that the structurally related protein Glo3, which is also dispensable, also exhibits ARF GAP activity. Genetic and in vitro approaches reveal that Glo3 and Gcs1 have an overlapping essential function at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi stage of vesicular transport. Mutant cells deficient for both ARF GAPs cannot proliferate, undergo a dramatic accumulation of ER and are defective for protein transport between ER and Golgi. The glo3Delta and gcs1Delta single mutations each interact with a sec21 mutation that affects a component of COPI, which mediates vesicular transport within the ER-Golgi shuttle, while increased dosage of the BET1, BOS1 and SEC22 genes encoding members of a v-SNARE family that functions within the ER-Golgi alleviates the effects of a glo3Delta mutation. An in vitro assay indicates that efficient retrieval from the Golgi to the ER requires these two proteins. These findings suggest that Glo3 and Gcs1 ARF GAPs mediate retrograde vesicular transport from the Golgi to the ER.",PMID: 9927415 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,833: Biochemistry  1998 Dec 22;37(51):17673-9 ,Dual function C-terminal domain of dynamin-1: modulation of self-assembly by interaction of the assembly site with SH3 domains.
"Impairment of endocytosis by mutational targeting of dynamin-1 GTPases can result in paralysis and embryonic lethality. Dynamin-1 assembles at coated pits where it functions to cleave vesicles from donor membranes. Receptor endocytosis is modulated by SH3 (src homology 3) domain proteins, which directly bind to dynamin C-terminal proline motif sequences, affecting both the dynamin GTPase activity and its recruitment to coated pits. We have determined that dynamin-dynamin interactions, which are required for dynamin helix formation, involve these same SH3 domain-binding C-terminal proline motif sequences. Consequently, SH3 domain proteins induce the in vitro disassembly of dynamin helices. Our results therefore suggest the the dual function of the dynamin C-terminus (involving amino acids 800-840) permits direct regulation of dynamin assembly and function through interaction with SH3 domain proteins. Additionally, the N-terminal GTPase domain plays an important role in assembly. Finally, we show that the central PH (pleckstrin homology) domain exerts a strong inhibitory effect on the capacity for dynamin-1 self-assembly.",PMID: 9922133 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,834: Biochemistry  1998 Dec 22;37(51):17637-41 ,Structure and function of the core histone N-termini: more than meets the eye.
"For two decades, the core histone N-termini generally have been thought of as unstructured domains whose function is to bind to DNA and screen negative charge. New data indicates that both the molecular mechanisms of action and biological functions of the core histone N-termini in chromatin are considerably more complex. At the level of the chromatin fiber, multiple distinct functions of the N-termini are required to achieve higher order chromatin condensation, two of which apparently involve protein-protein rather than protein-DNA interactions. In addition, the N-termini have been documented to participate in specific interactions with many chromatin-associated regulatory proteins. Here, we discuss evidence supporting the new concepts that when functioning in their natural chromatin context, (1) the N-termini are engaged primarily in protein-protein interactions, (2) as a consequence of these interactions the N-termini adopt specific secondary structure, (3) posttranslational modifications such as acetylation disrupt the ability of the N-termini to form secondary structure, and (4) because the N-termini perform essential roles in both chromatin condensation and also bind specific chromatin-associated proteins, the global structure and function of any given region of the genome will be determined predominantly by the core histone N-termini and their specific interaction partners.","Publication Types: Review Review, Tutorial",PMID: 9922128 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,835: J Biol Chem  1999 Jan 29;274(5):2609-12

Rho family members containing an arginine residue at position 186 in the C-terminal polybasic region were found to possess a self-stimulatory GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity through homophilic interaction, resulting in significantly enhanced intrinsic GTPase activities. This arginine residue functions effectively as an ""arginine finger"" in the GTPase activating reaction to confer the catalytic GAP activity but is not essential for the homophilic binding interactions of Rho family proteins. The arginine 186-mediated negative regulation seems to be absent from Cdc42, a Rho family member important for cell-division cycle regulation, of lower eukaryotes, yet appears to be a part of the turn-off machinery of Cdc42 from higher eukaryotes. Introduction of the arginine 186 mutation into S. cerevisiae CDC42 led to phenotypes consistent with down-regulated CDC42 function.

In this study, we found (using the yeast two-hybrid system) that Gts1p forms homodimers throughout the 18-amino acid region 296-313 which has considerable similarity to a region downstream of the Walker nucleotide-binding motif A of some ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. The region contains two aspartic acid residues at 301 and 310 preceded by hydrophobic amino acid residues, and Gts1p with an Asp310 to Ala substitution showed considerably reduced homodimerization, as shown by the two-hybrid assay. Overexpression of the point-mutated Gts1p did not efficiently induce the Gts1p-related phenotypes described above, suggesting that the homodimerization of Gts1p is required for it to function in vivo. The C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the yeast ABC transporters Mdl1p (multidrug resistance-like transporter) and Ycf1p (yeast cadmium factor or glutathione S-conjugate pump) bound to Gts1p in the two-hybrid system, and the heterodimerization activity of the Gts1p with the Asp301 to Ala substitution was more affected than the Gts1p with the Asp310 to Ala substitution. Overexpression of GTS1 considerably reduced, and disruption of GTS1 slightly decreased, cellular resistance to cycloheximide, cadmium, cisplatin and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrophenol, which (except for cycloheximide) are all substrates of Ycf1p.

Here we demonstrate that GRISEA activates in vivo gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and is characterized by a modular organization. The DNA-binding domain was mapped to the first 168 N-terminal amino acids and the transactivation domain to the C-terminal half of the protein. Increased levels of copper in the growth medium lead to repression of the transactivation function possibly via intramolecular interactions between parts of the DNA-binding domain and the transactivation domain. The wild-type copy of Grisea was found to complement the phenotype of the mac1-1 mutant of S. cerevisiae. GRISEA is able to bind to the promoter of CTR1, a MAC1 target gene that encodes a high-affinity copper transporter. Taken together, the data reported here and in earlier investigations indicate that GRISEA is an ortholog of the yeast transcription factor MAC1 and suggest at least a partial conservation of the molecular machinery involved in the control of cellular copper homeostasis in eukaryotes.

Each subunit of the pentameric receptor protein has ligand-binding sites in the amino-terminal extracellular domain and four membrane-spanning regions, one of which forms a wall of the ion channel. Each subunit also has a large intracellular loop that may be a target for protein kinases and be required for subcellular targeting and membrane clustering of the receptor, perhaps by anchoring the receptor to the cytoskeleton. Neurotransmitter receptors need to be positioned in high density in the cell membrane at sites postsynaptic to nerve terminals releasing that neurotransmitter. Other members of the superfamily of ligand-gated ion-channel receptors associate in postsynaptic-membrane clusters by binding to the proteins rapsyn or gephyrin.

After docking at the nuclear pore complex (NPC), the cargo-receptor complex moves through the aqueous pore channel. Once cargo is released, the importin then moves back through the channel for new rounds of transport. Thus, importin and exportin, another member of this family involved in export, are thought to continuously shuttle between the nuclear interior and the cytoplasm. In order to understand how nuclear transporters traverse the NPC, we constructed functional protein fusions between several members of the yeast importin family, including Pse1p, Sxm1p, Xpo1p, and Kap95p, and the green fluorescent protein (GFP). Complexes containing nuclear transporters were isolated by using highly specific anti-GFP antibodies. Pse1-GFP was studied in the most detail. Pse1-GFP is in a complex with importin-alpha and -beta (Srp1p and Kap95p in yeast cells) that is sensitive to the nucleotide-bound state of the Ran GTPase. In addition, Pse1p associates with the nucleoporins Nsp1p, Nup159p, and Nup116p, while Sxm1p, Xpo1p, and Kap95p show different patterns of interaction with nucleoporins. Association of Pse1p with nucleoporins also depends on the nucleotide-bound state of Ran; when Ran is in the GTP-bound state, the nucleoporin association is lost. A mutant form of Pse1p that does not bind Ran also fails to interact with nucleoporins. These data indicate that transport receptors such as Pse1p interact in a Ran-dependent manner with certain nucleoporins.

A major puzzle of these studies was that overexpression of Hsp104 alone, from a heterologous promoter, cures cells of [PSI] very efficiently, yet the natural induction of Hsp104 with heat shock, stationary-phase growth, or sporulation does not. These observations pointed to a mechanism for protecting the genetic information carried by the [PSI] element from vicissitudes of the environment. Here, we show that simultaneous overexpression of Ssa1, a protein of the Hsp70 family, protects [PSI] from curing by overexpression of Hsp104. Ssa1 protein belongs to the Ssa subfamily, members of which are normally induced with Hsp104 during heat shock, stationary-phase growth, and sporulation. At the molecular level, excess Ssa1 prevents a shift of Sup35 protein from the insoluble (prion) to the soluble (cellular) state in the presence of excess Hsp104. Overexpression of Ssa1 also increases nonsense suppression by [PSI] when Hsp104 is expressed at its normal level. In contrast, hsp104 deletion strains lose [PSI] even in the presence of overproduced Ssa1. Overproduction of the unrelated chaperone protein Hsp82 (Hsp90) neither cured [PSI] nor antagonized the [PSI]-curing effect of overproduced Hsp104.

We have found many synthetic genetic interactions between factors within the Paf1p-Cdc73p complex, including the lethality of paf1Delta ccr4Delta, paf1Delta hpr1Delta, ccr4Delta hpr1Delta, and ccr4Delta gal11Delta double mutants. In addition, paf1Delta and ccr4Delta are lethal in combination with srb5Delta, indicating that the factors within and between the two RNA polymerase II complexes have overlapping essential functions. We have used differential display to identify several genes whose expression is affected by mutations in components of the Paf1p-Cdc73p-Pol II complex. Additionally, as previously observed for hpr1Delta, deleting PAF1 or CDC73 leads to elevated recombination between direct repeats.

HAP1-18 harbors an amino acid change in the DNA binding domain. While binding UAS1 poorly, HAP1-18 binds UAS(CYC7) with wild-type properties and activates transcription at elevated levels relative to HAP1. We have determined the structure of HAP1-18-UAS(CYC7) and have compared it to HAP1-UAS(CYC7). Unexpectedly, the single amino acid substitution in HAP1-18 nucleates a significantly altered hydrogen bond interface between the protein and DNA resulting in DNA conformational changes and an ordering of one N-terminal arm of the protein dimer along the DNA minor groove. These observations, together with a large subset of transcriptionally defective mutations in the HAP1 DNA-binding domain that map to the HAP1-DNA interface, suggest that protein-DNA interactions may have direct allosteric effects on transcriptional activation.",PMID: 9886287 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,845: Toxicol Appl Pharmacol  1999 Jan 1;154(1):76-83

Xenobiotics may modify natural endocrine function and so affect human health and wildlife. It is necessary, therefore, to understand the degree to which xenobiotics can disrupt endocrine systems. The key targets of endocrine disruptors are nuclear hormone receptors, which bind to steroid hormones and regulate their gene transcription. We have developed relevant assay systems based on the ligand-dependent interaction between nuclear hormone receptor and coactivator. The coactivators used in this study contained CBP, p300, RIP140, SRC1, TIF1, and TIF2. By two hybrid assay in yeast, the interactions of estrogen receptor with RIP140, SRC1, TIF1, and TIF2 were detected and they were completely dependent on the presence of estrogen. Specificity of this assay was assessed by determining the effect of steroids, known estrogen receptor agonists, and phytoestrogens. The pattern of response to chemicals were consistent with estrogenic activity measured by other assay systems, indicating that this assay system is reliable for measuring estrogenic activity. In addition, we carried out in vitro binding studies: GST pull-down assay and surface plasmon resonance analysis. The estrogen receptor also bound to coactivator in response to chemicals depending on their estrogenic activity in vitro. These data demonstrate that the measurement of interaction between steroid hormone receptor and coactivator serves as a useful tool for identifying chemicals that interact with steroid receptors.

"Molecular Membrane Biology Laboratory, RIKEN, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan.","The yeast SAR1 gene encodes a low-molecular-weight GTPase which is essential for the formation of transport vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To understand how the Sar1p function is regulated in its GTPase cycle, we searched for multicopy suppressors of sar1 temperature-sensitive mutants and identified SEC12, SED4, truncated SEC16, and EKS1. EKS1 turns out to be identical to HRD3, which was independently isolated as a gene implicated in the degradation of an HMG-CoA reductase isozyme, Hmg2p. In this paper, we show that the product of EKS1/HRD3 is a type-I transmembrane glycoprotein and resides in the ER. The eks1/hrd3 disrupted cells are normal in growth and transport of cargo proteins, but missecrete BiP (Kar2p). The overexpression of EKS1/HRD3, which stabilizes Hmg2p, did not affect the stability of wild-type or mutant Sar1p or any early Sec proteins we examined. These results suggest that the role of Eks1p/Hrd3p is not involved in the ER protein degradation in general but rather required for the maintenance of the ER membrane functions. The novel genetic interactions unveiled between SAR1, SEC12, SEC16, and SED4 will provide useful information as to how the complex machinery of vesicle budding operates.",PMID: 9880808 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,847: Biochim Biophys Acta  1999 Jan 6;1426(2):323-34

H3A 1B1, Canada.","Glycosylation constitutes one of the most important of all the post-translational modifications and may have numerous effects on the function, structure, physical properties and targeting of particular proteins. Eukaryotic glycan structures are progressively elaborated in the secretory pathway. Following the addition of a core N-linked carbohydrate in the endoplasmic reticulum, glycoproteins move to the Golgi complex where the elongation of O-linked sugar chains and processing of complex N-linked oligosaccharide structures take place. In order to better define how such post-translational modifications occur, we have been studying the yeast KTR and MNN1 mannosyltransferase gene families. The KTR family contains nine members: KRE2, YUR1, KTR1, KTR2, KTR3, KTR4, KTR5, KTR6 and KTR7. The MNN1 family contains six members: MNN1, TTP1, YGL257c, YNR059w, YIL014w and YJL86w. In this review, we address protein structure, sequence similarities and enzymatic activity in the context of each gene family.

Conserved core structure in the internal transcribed spacer 1 of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe precursor ribosomal RNA.,"Lalev AI, Nazar RN.","Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, N1G 2W1, Canada.","The structure of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) in Schizosaccharomyces pombe was examined with respect to phylogenetically conserved features in yeasts as well as the binding of transacting factors that potentially play a role in ribosomal maturation. Computer analyses and probes for nuclease protection indicate a compact, more highly organized structure than previously proposed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with distinct structural features which can be recognized in S. cerevisiae. These include a central extended hairpin structure as well as smaller hairpins immediately adjacent to the maturing termini. Comparisons with ITS sequences in more diverse organisms indicate that the same features also can be recognized. This is especially clear in organisms which contain very short sequences in which the putative structures are much less ambiguous. Again nuclease protection analyses in one of these, Verticillium albo-atrum, confirm a central hairpin with additional hairpins linked to the maturing termini. Protein binding and gel retardation studies with the S. pombe ITS1 further indicate that, as observed in the 3' external transcripted spacer (ETS) region, the extended hairpin is not only the site of intermediate RNA cleavage during rRNA processing, but also a site for specific interactions with one or more soluble factors. Taken together with other analyses on transcribed spacer regions, the present data provide evidence that the spacer regions act not only to organize the maturing terminal sequences but also may serve to organize specific soluble factors, possibly acting in a manner which is analogous with that of the free small nucleolar ribonucleo protein particles (snoRNPs).

Epistatic interactions of deletion mutants in the genes encoding the F1-ATPase in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"Lai-Zhang J, Xiao Y, Mueller DM.","Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Chicago Medical School, North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.","The F1-ATPase is a multimeric enzyme (alpha3 beta3 gamma delta epsilon) primarily responsible for the synthesis of ATP under aerobic conditions. The entire coding region of each of the genes was deleted separately in yeast, providing five null mutant strains. Strains with a deletion in the genes encoding alpha-, beta-, gamma- or delta-subunits were unable to grow, while the strain with a null mutation in epsilon was able to grow slowly on medium containing glycerol as the carbon source. In addition, strains with a null mutation in gamma or delta became 100% rho0/rho- and the strain with the null mutation in gamma grew much more slowly on medium containing glucose. These additional phenotypes were not observed in strains with the double mutations: Delta alpha Delta gamma, Delta beta Delta gamma, Deltaatp11 Delta gamma, Delta alpha Delta delta, Delta beta Delta delta or Deltaatp11 Delta delta. These results indicate that epsilon is not an essential component of the ATP synthase and that mutations in the genes encoding the alpha- and beta-subunits and in ATP11 are epistatic to null mutations in the genes encoding the gamma- and delta-subunits. These data suggest that the propensity to form rho0/rho- mutations in the gamma and delta null deletion mutant stains and the slow growing phenotypes of the null gamma mutant strain are due to the assembly of F1 deficient in the corresponding subunit. These results have profound implications for the physiology of normal cells.",PMID: 9878050 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
A region of the Sir1 protein dedicated to recognition of a silencer and required for interaction with the Orc1 protein in saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"Gardner KA, Rine J, Fox CA.","Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA.","Silencing of the cryptic mating-type loci HMR and HML requires the recognition of DNA sequence elements called silencers by the Sir1p, one of four proteins dedicated to the assembly of silenced chromatin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Sir1p is thought to recognize silencers indirectly through interactions with proteins that bind the silencer DNA directly, such as the origin recognition complex (ORC). Eight recessive alleles of SIR1 were discovered that encode mutant Sir1 proteins specifically defective in their ability to recognize the HMR-E silencer. The eight missense mutations all map within a 17-amino-acid segment of Sir1p, and this segment was also required for Sir1p's interaction with Orc1p. The mutant Sir1 proteins could function in silencing if tethered to a silencer directly through a heterologous DNA-binding domain. Thus the amino acids identified are required for Sir1 protein's recognition of the HMR-E silencer and interaction with Orc1p, but not for its ability to function in silencing per se. The approach used to find these mutations may be applicable to defining interaction surfaces on proteins involved in other processes that require the assembly of macromolecular complexes.",PMID: 9872946 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Maintenance of sister-chromatid cohesion at the centromere by the Drosophila MEI-S332 protein.,"Tang TT, Bickel SE, Young LM, Orr-Weaver TL.","Whitehead Institute and Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts USA 02142, USA.","Sister-chromatid cohesion is essential for the faithful segregation of chromosomes during cell division. Recently biochemical analysis with Xenopus extracts suggests that cohesion is established during S phase by a cohesion complex but that other proteins must maintain it in mitosis. The Drosophila melanogaster MEI-S332 protein is present on centromeres in mitosis and meiosis and is essential for cohesion at the centromeres in meiosis II. Here, we analyze the timing of MEI-S332 assembly onto centromeres and the functional domains of the MEI-S332 protein. We find that MEI-S332 is first detectable on chromosomes during prometaphase, and this localization is independent of microtubules. MEI-S332 contains two separable functional domains, as mutations within these domains show intragenic complementation. The carboxy-terminal basic region is required for chromosomal localization. The amino-terminal coiled-coil domain may facilitate protein-protein interactions between MEI-S332 and male meiotic proteins. MEI-S332 interacts with itself in the yeast two-hybrid assay and in immunoprecipitates from Drosophila oocyte and embryo extracts. Thus it appears that MEI-S332 assembles into a multimeric protein complex that localizes to centromeric regions during prometaphase and is required for the maintenance of sister-chromatid cohesion until anaphase, rather than its establishment in S phase.",PMID: 9869638 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Decoupling of nucleotide- and microtubule-binding sites in a kinesin mutant.,"Song H, Endow SA.","Department of Microbiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.","Molecular motors require ATP to move along microtubules or actin filaments. To understand how molecular motors function, it is crucial to know how binding of the motor to its filamentous track stimulates the hydrolysis of ATP by the motor, enabling it to move along the filament. A mechanism for the enhanced ATP hydrolysis has not been elucidated, but it is generally accepted that conformational changes in the motor proteins occur when they bind to microtubules or actin filaments, facilitating the release of ADP. Here we report that a mutation in the motor domain of the microtubule motor proteins Kar3 and Ncd uncouples nucleotide- and microtubule-binding by the proteins, preventing activation of the motor ATPase by microtubules. Unlike the wild-type motors, the mutants bind tightly to both ADP and microtubules, indicating that interactions between the nucleotide- and microtubule-binding sites are blocked. The region of the motor that includes the mutated amino acid could transmit or undergo a conformational change required to convert the motor ATPase into a microtubule-stimulated state.",PMID: 9859995 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Ribosomal protein S14 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae regulates its expression by binding to RPS14B pre-mRNA and to 18S rRNA.,"Fewell SW, Woolford JL Jr.","Department of Biological Sciences, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, USA.","Production of ribosomal protein S14 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is coordinated with the rate of ribosome assembly by a feedback mechanism that represses expression of RPS14B. Three-hybrid assays in vivo and filter binding assays in vitro demonstrate that rpS14 directly binds to an RNA stem-loop structure in RPS14B pre-mRNA that is necessary for RPS14B regulation. Moreover, rpS14 binds to a conserved helix in 18S rRNA with approximately five- to sixfold-greater affinity. These results support the model that RPS14B regulation is mediated by direct binding of rpS14 either to its pre-mRNA or to rRNA. Investigation of these interactions with the three-hybrid system reveals two regions of rpS14 that are involved in RNA recognition. D52G and E55G mutations in rpS14 alter the specificity of rpS14 for RNA, as indicated by increased affinity for RPS14B RNA but reduced affinity for the rRNA target. Deletion of the C terminus of rpS14, where multiple antibiotic resistance mutations map, prevents binding of rpS14 to RNA and production of functional 40S subunits. The emetine-resistant protein, rpS14-EmRR, which contains two mutations near the C terminus of rpS14, does not bind either RNA target in the three-hybrid or in vitro assays. This is the first direct demonstration that an antibiotic resistance mutation alters binding of an r protein to rRNA and is consistent with the hypothesis that antibiotic resistance mutations can result from local alterations in rRNA structure.",PMID: 9858605 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Genetic evidence for Pak1 autoinhibition and its release by Cdc42.,"Tu H, Wigler M.","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724, USA.","Pak1 protein kinase of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a member of the p21-GTPase-activated protein kinase (PAK) family, participates in signaling pathways including sexual differentiation and morphogenesis.

Here we report the detection in the two-hybrid system of the interaction between Pak1 regulatory domain and the kinase catalytic domain. Pak1 catalytic domain binds to the same highly conserved region on the regulatory domain that binds Cdc42, a GTPase protein capable of activating Pak1. Two-hybrid, mutant, and genetic analyses indicated that this intramolecular interaction rendered the kinase in a closed and inactive configuration.

"Isoform-specific interaction of the cytoplasmic domains of Na,K-ATPase.","Yoon T, Lee K.","College of Pharmacy, Ewha Woman's University, Seoul, Korea.","The Na,K-ATPase is a heterodimer consisting of an alpha and a beta subunit, which exchanges intracellular Na+ for extracellular K+ using the energy of ATP hydrolysis. Several studies have demonstrated that the enzyme exists as an (alphabeta)2 heterotetramer, an oligomer of alphabeta dimers within the cell membrane, at least during some portion of the transport cycle although its functional significance is unknown. In our study, we employed the yeast two-hybrid system to identify the cytoplasmic domains of the Na,K-ATPase which might be involved in intersubunit and/or intrasubunit interactions to form higher order oligmers. Our data demonstrate that the N-terminus and the cytoplasmic loop 1 of the alpha2 subunit interact with each other, while those of the alpha1 subunit do not, suggesting that the interaction is isoform-specific. Therefore, the N-terminal and the cytoplasmic loop 1 might be the regions where the alpha2 subunit, which are involved in alpha alpha interactions, stabilize Na,K-ATPase as alphabeta protomer, diprotomer, or higher order oligomer because the interaction can be intrasubunit as well as intersubunit interactions. Our study suggests that there may be an isoform-specific difference in the alpha-alpha interaction and that the isoform-specific interaction may contribute significantly to the differences of the physiological function and regulation among the alpha isoforms.",PMID: 9856349 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
The role of the C-terminal region in phosphoglycerate mutase.,"Walter RA, Nairn J, Duncan D, Price NC, Kelly SM, Rigden DJ, Fothergill-Gilmore LA.","Department of Biochemistry, University of Edinburgh, George Square, Edinburgh EH8 9XD, Scotland, U.K.","Removal of the C-terminal seven residues from phosphoglycerate mutase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae by limited proteolysis is associated with loss of mutase activity, but no change in phosphatase activity. The presence of the cofactor 2, 3-bisphosphoglycerate, or of the cofactor and substrate 3-phosphoglycerate together, confers protection against proteolysis. The substrate alone offers no protection. Replacement of either or both of the two lysines at the C-terminus by glycines has only limited effects on the kinetic properties of phosphoglycerate mutase, indicating that these residues are unlikely to be involved in crucial electrostatic interactions with the substrate, intermediate or product in the reaction. However, the double-mutant form of the enzyme is more sensitive to proteolysis and is no longer protected against proteolysis by the presence of cofactor. The proteolysed wild-type and two of the mutated forms of the enzyme show a reduced response to 2-phosphoglycollate, which enhances the instability of the phospho form of the native enzyme. The phosphoglycerate mutase from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which lacks the analogous C-terminal tail, has an inherently lower mutase activity and is also less responsive to stimulation by 2-phosphoglycollate. It is proposed that the C-terminal region of phosphoglycerate mutase helps to maintain the enzyme in its active phosphorylated form and assists in the retention of the bisphosphoglycerate intermediate at the active site. However, its role seems not to be to contribute directly to ligand binding, but rather to exert indirect effects on the transfer of the phospho group between substrate, enzyme, intermediate and product.",PMID: 9854029 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

First, to investigate whether there are synergistic interactions among multiple bound factors, we studied promoter constructions containing one or five Gal4 sites and found that a single recognition site is sufficient for Gal4-VP16 to bind to chromatin, to induce nucleosome rearrangement, and to activate transcription. Notably, we observed that Gal4-VP16 binds to a single site in chromatin with affinity comparable with that which it binds to naked DNA, even in the absence of ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling activity. Second, to explore the relation between translational nucleosome positioning and transcriptional activation, we analyzed a series of promoter constructions in which nucleosomes were positioned by Gal4-VP16 at different locations relative to the RNA start site. These experiments revealed that the positioning of a nucleosome over the RNA start site is not an absolute barrier to transcriptional activation. Third, to determine the contribution of core promoter elements to transcriptional activation with chromatin templates, we tested the ability of Gal4-VP16 to activate transcription with TATA box- versus DPE-driven core promoters and found that the TATA box is not required to achieve transcriptional activation by Gal4-VP16 with chromatin templates. These results suggest that a single protomer of a strong activator is able to bind to chromatin, to induce nucleosome remodeling, and to activate transcription in conjunction with a broad range of chromatin structures and core promoter elements.",PMID: 9852139 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Evidence for a salt bridge between transmembrane segments 5 and 6 of the yeast plasma-membrane H+-ATPase.,"Gupta SS, DeWitt ND, Allen KE, Slayman CW.","Departments of Genetics and Cellular & Molecular Physiology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA.","The plasma-membrane H+-ATPase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which belongs to the P2 subgroup of cation-transporting ATPases, is encoded by the PMA1 gene and functions physiologically to pump protons out of the cell. This study has focused on hydrophobic transmembrane segments M5 and M6 of the H+-ATPase. In particular, a conserved aspartate residue near the middle of M6 has been found to play a critical role in the structure and biogenesis of the ATPase. Site-directed mutants in which Asp-730 was replaced by an uncharged residue (Asn or Val) were abnormally sensitive to trypsin, consistent with the idea that the proteins were poorly folded, and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy showed them to be arrested in the endoplasmic reticulum. Similar defects are known to occur when either Arg-695 or His-701 in M5 is replaced by a neutral residue (Dutra, M. B., Ambesi, A., and Slayman, C. W. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 17411-17417). To search for possible charge-charge interactions between Asp-730 and Arg-695 or His-701, double mutants were constructed in which positively and negatively charged residues were swapped or eliminated. Strikingly, two of the double mutants (R695D/D730R and R695A/D730A) regained the capacity for normal biogenesis and displayed near-normal rates of ATP hydrolysis and ATP-dependent H+ pumping. These results demonstrate that neither Arg-695 nor Asp-730 is required for enzymatic activity or proton transport, but suggest that there is a salt bridge between the two residues, linking M5 and M6 of the 100-kDa polypeptide.",PMID: 9852098 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

Photo-crosslinking with uniformly labeled U5 RNA in snRNPs reconstituted in vitro revealed five contacting proteins, Prp8p, Snu114p, p30, p16, and p10, contact by the three smaller proteins requiring an intact Sm site. Site-specific crosslinking showed that Snu114p contacts the 5' side of internal loop 1, whereas Prp8p interacts with five different regions of the 5' stem-loop, but not with the Sm site or 3' stem-loop. Both internal loops in the 5' domain are essential for Prp8p to associate with the snRNP, but the conserved loop 1 is not, although this is the region to which Prp8p crosslinks most strongly. The extensive contacts between Prp8p and the 5' stem-loop of U5 RNA support the hypothesis that, in spliceosomes, Prp8p stabilizes loop 1-exon interactions. Moreover, data showing that Prp8p contacts the exons even in the absence of loop 1 indicate that Prp8p may be the principal anchoring factor for exons in the spliceosome. This and the close proximity of the spliceosomal translocase, Snu114p, to U5 loop 1 and Prp8p support and extend the proposal that Snu114p mimics U5 loop 1 during a translocation event in the spliceosome.",Publication Types: Corrected and Republished Article

We have shown previously that Myo2p is required for the movement of a portion of the lysosome (vacuole) into the bud and consequently for proper inheritance of this organelle during cell division. Class V myosins have a globular carboxyl terminal tail domain that is proposed to mediate localization of the myosin, possibly through interaction with organelle-specific receptors. Here we describe a myo2 allele whose phenotypes support this hypothesis. vac15-1/myo2-2 has a single mutation in this globular tail domain, causing defects in vacuole movement and inheritance. Although a portion of wild-type Myo2p fractionates with the vacuole, the myo2-2 gene product does not. In addition, the mutant protein does not concentrate at sites of active growth, the predominant location of wild-type Myo2p. Although deletion of the tail domain is lethal, the myo2-2 gene product retains the essential functions of Myo2p. Moreover, myo2-2 does not cause the growth defects and lethal genetic interactions seen in myo2-66, a mutant defective in the actin-binding domain. These observations suggest that the myo2-2 mutation specifically disrupts interactions with selected myosin receptors, namely those on the vacuole membrane and those at sites of polarized growth."

Although the cytosolic hsc70 (Ssa1p) and the ER lumenal hsc70 (BiP) are homologous, they cannot substitute for one another, possibly because they interact with specific DnaJ homologues on each side of the ER membrane. To investigate this possibility, we purified Ssa1p, BiP, Ydj1p (a cytosolic DnaJ homologue), and a GST-63Jp fusion protein containing the lumenal DnaJ region of Sec63p. We observed that BiP, but not Ssa1p, is able to associate with GST-63Jp and that Ydj1p stimulates the ATPase activity of Ssa1p up to 10-fold but increases the ATPase activity of BiP by <2-fold. In addition, Ydj1p and ATP trigger the release of an unfolded polypeptide from Ssa1p but not from BiP. To understand further how BiP drives protein translocation, we purified four dominant lethal mutants of BiP. We discovered that each mutant is defective for ATP hydrolysis, fails to undergo an ATP-dependent conformational change, and cannot interact with GST-63Jp. Measurements of protein translocation into reconstituted proteoliposomes indicate that the mutants inhibit translocation even in the presence of wild-type BiP. We conclude that a conformation- and ATP-dependent interaction of BiP with the J domain of Sec63p is essential for protein translocation and that the specificity of hsc70 action is dictated by their DnaJ partners."

Further analysis of the interactions within the Nup159p/Nsp1p/Nup82p subcomplex using the nup82Delta108 mutant strain revealed that a deletion within the carboxyl-terminal domain of Nup82p prevents its interaction with Nsp1p but does not affect the interaction between Nup159p and Nsp1p. Moreover, immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that Nup159p is delocalized from the NPC in nup82Delta108 cells grown at 37 degrees C, a temperature at which the Nup82Delta108p mutant protein becomes degraded. This suggests that Nup82p may act as a docking site for a core complex composed of the repeat-containing nucleoporins Nup159p and Nsp1p. In vivo transport assays further revealed that nup82Delta108 and nup159-1/rat7-1 mutant strains have little if any defect in nuclear protein import and protein export. Together our data suggest that the poly(A)+ RNA export defect previously observed in nup82 mutant cells might be due to the loss from the NPCs of the repeat-containing nucleoporin Nup159p."

Domain 5 (D5) is a highly conserved region of the intron that is considered one of the most critical structures in the catalytic core. Despite its central importance, the means by which D5 interacts with other core elements is unclear. To obtain a map of potential interaction sites, dimethyl sulfate was used to footprint regions of the intron that are involved in D5 binding. These studies were complemented by measurements of D5 binding to a series of truncated intron derivatives. In this way, the minimal region of the intron required for strong D5 association was defined and the sites most likely to represent thermodynamically significant positions of tertiary contact were identified. These studies show that ground-state D5 binding is mediated by tertiary contacts to specific regions of D1, including a tetraloop receptor and an adjacent three-way junction. In contrast, D2 and D3 are not found to stabilize D5 association. These data highlight the significance of D1-D5 interactions and will facilitate the identification of specific tertiary contacts between them."

The salt dependence of TBP binding to both promoters is identical within experimental error while the temperature dependence differs significantly. The observed rate of association follows simple second-order kinetics over the TBP concentration ranges investigated. The salt and temperature dependencies of the second-order association rate constants for TBP binding the two promoters reflect the dependencies determined by equilibrium binding. The TBP-E4 promoter interaction is entropically driven at low temperature and enthalpically driven at high temperature while the TBP-Major Late promoter reaction is entropically driven over virtually the entire temperature range investigated.

Functionally, the D2-like receptors are characterized by their ability to inhibit adenylyl cyclase. The dopamine D4 receptor as well as many other catecholaminergic receptors contain several putative SH3 binding domains. Most of these sites in the D4 receptor are located in a polymorphic repeat sequence and flanking sequences in the third intracellular loop. Here we demonstrate that this region of the D4 receptor can interact with a large variety of SH3 domains of different origin. The strongest interactions were seen with the SH2-SH3 adapter proteins Grb2 and Nck. The repeat sequence itself is not essential in this interaction. The data presented indicate that the different SH3 domains in the adapter proteins interact in a cooperative fashion with two distinct sites immediately upstream and downstream from the repeat sequence. Removal of all the putative SH3 binding domains in the third intracellular loop of the dopamine D4 receptor resulted in a receptor that could still bind spiperone and dopamine. Dopamine could not modulate the coupling of these mutant receptors to adenylyl cyclase and MAPK, although dopamine modulated receptor-G protein interaction appeared normal. The receptor deletion mutants show strong constitutive internalization that may account for the deficiency in functional activation of second messengers. The data indicates that the D4 receptor contains SH3 binding sites and that these sites fall within a region involved in the control of receptor internalization."

J.McCarthy@umist.ac.uk","Studies of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have greatly advanced our understanding of the posttranscriptional steps of eukaryotic gene expression. Given the wide range of experimental tools applicable to S. cerevisiae and the recent determination of its complete genomic sequence, many of the key challenges of the posttranscriptional control field can be tackled particularly effectively by using this organism. This article reviews the current knowledge of the cellular components and mechanisms related to translation and mRNA decay, with the emphasis on the molecular basis for rate control and gene regulation. Recent progress in characterizing translation factors and their protein-protein and RNA-protein interactions has been rapid. Against the background of a growing body of structural information, the review discusses the thermodynamic and kinetic principles that govern the translation process. As in prokaryotic systems, translational initiation is a key point of control. Modulation of the activities of translational initiation factors imposes global regulation in the cell, while structural features of particular 5' untranslated regions, such as upstream open reading frames and effector binding sites, allow for gene-specific regulation. Recent data have revealed many new details of the molecular mechanisms involved while providing insight into the functional overlaps and molecular networking that are apparently a key feature of evolving cellular systems. An overall picture of the mechanisms governing mRNA decay has only very recently begun to develop. The latest work has revealed new information about the mRNA decay pathways, the components of the mRNA degradation machinery, and the way in which these might relate to the translation apparatus. Overall, major challenges still to be addressed include the task of relating principles of posttranscriptional control to cellular compartmentalization and polysome structure and the role of molecular channelling in these highly complex expression systems."

Although the interaction is specific, it can be competed by RNA sequences that do not contain the same type of efficiency element; that is, a sequence lacking a (UA)3repeat.

We addressed the possibility that Cak1 is also required for the activation of other yeast CDKs, such as Kin28, Pho85, and Srb10. We generated three new temperature-sensitive cak1 mutant strains, which arrested at the restrictive temperature with nonuniform budding morphology. All three cak1 mutants displayed significant synthetic interactions with loss-of-function mutations in CDC28 and KIN28. Loss of Cak1 function reduced the phosphorylation and activity of both Cdc28 and Kin28 but did not affect the activity of Pho85 or Srb10. In the presence of the Kin28 regulatory subunits Ccl1 and Tfb3, Kin28 was phosphorylated and activated when coexpressed with Cak1 in insect cells.

We have shown that the FH proteins Bni1p and Bnr1p are potential targets of the Rho family small GTP-binding proteins and bind to an actin-binding protein, profilin, at their proline-rich FH1 domains to regulate reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found here that a novel Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-containing protein, encoded by YMR032w, interacted with Bnr1p in a GTP-Rho4p-dependent manner through the FH1 domain of Bnr1p and the SH3 domain of Ymr032wp. Ymr032wp weakly bound to Bni1p. Ymr032wp was homologous to cdc15p, which is involved in cytokinesis in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and we named this gene HOF1 (homolog of cdc 15). Both Bnr1p and Hof1p were localized at the bud neck, and both the bnr1 and hof1 mutations showed synthetic lethal interactions with the bni1 mutation. The hof1 mutant cells showed phenotypes similar to those of the septin mutants, indicating that HOF1 is involved in cytokinesis.

These are characterized by the presence of a conserved sequence of 80-100 residues, which constitutes the putative C-terminal domain. Like other sHsps, alphaB-crystallin forms multimeric globular complexes, often in combination with related sHsps. Here we show that in a yeast two-hybrid system, alphaB-crystallin can specifically interact with itself as well as with alphaA-crystallin and Hsp27. Analyses of the separate domains show that the conserved C-terminal domain (CalphaB) is essential for this interaction between subunits. To try and detect residues that are important in subunit interaction, the CalphaB domain was used in a two-hybrid screen as bait to select randomly mutated CalphaB mutants. In this way we obtained nine mutants that were still able to interact with wild-type CalphaB despite the presence of up to 15 replacements. Similarly, we obtained 16 mutants that were unable to bind, because of the presence of just three to nine replacements. In binding CalphaB mutants, lysine residues were most often replaced by glutamic acid residues, and in non-binding CalphaB mutants, acidic residues were often found to be replaced by non-charged residues. This indicates that negative charges are important for subunit interaction and we propose a model to explain this role of acidic residues. Furthermore, we observed that two homologs of alphaB-crystallin, alphaA-crystallin and Hsp27, generally interact similarly with the binding and non-binding CalphaB mutants as does alphaB-crystallin. This suggests that interactions involved in the complex formation of these three sHsps are largely comparable.",PMID: 9774426 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,

Many of these tyrosine motifs conform to the consensus YXXPhi (where Phi represents a bulky hydrophobic residue). This YXXPhi motif has been shown to interact with the medium chain subunits of adaptor complexes that generally link relevant integral membrane protein cytosolic domains to the clathrin coat involved in vesicle formation. The motif YXXPhi is also very similar to motifs that are targets for phosphorylation by tyrosine kinases. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors known as tyrphostins are structural analogues of tyrosine, and so it is possible that tyrphostins could also inhibit interactions between medium chains and YXXPhi motifs. TGN38 is a type I integral membrane protein containing a tyrosine motif, YQRL, within the cytosolic domain. We have previously shown that this motif interacts directly with the medium chain subunit of the plasma membrane localized AP-2 adaptor complex (mu2). We have investigated a range of tyrphostins and demonstrated a specific inhibition of the interaction between mu2 and the TGN38 cytosolic domain by tyrphostin A23 through in vitro analysis and the yeast two-hybrid system.

The interactions between TLS and these two SR proteins were confirmed by co-transfection and immunoprecipitation studies. In vivo splicing assays indicated that SC35 and TASR influence splice site selection of adenovirus E1A pre-mRNA. TLS may recruit SR splicing factors to specific target genes through interaction with its C-terminal region, and chromosomal translocations that truncate the C-terminal region of TLS may prevent this interaction.

We have previously shown that the transcriptional activator protein Cha4p mediates serine/threonine induction of CHA1 expression. We used accessibility to micrococcal nuclease and DNase I to determine the in vivo chromatin structure of the CHA1 chromosomal locus, both in the non-induced state and upon induction. Upon activation, a precisely positioned nucleosome (nuc-1) occluding the TATA box and the transcription start site is removed. A strain devoid of Cha4p showed no chromatin alteration under inducing conditions. Five yeast TBP mutants defective in different steps in activated transcription abolished CHA1 expression, but failed to affect induction-dependent chromatin rearrangement of the promoter region. Progressive truncations of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain caused a progressive reduction in CHA1 transcription, but no difference in chromatin remodeling. Analysis of swi1, swi3, snf5 and snf6, as well as gcn5, ada2 and ada3 mutants, suggested that neither the SWI/SNF complex nor the ADA/GCN5 complex is involved in efficient activation and/or remodeling of the CHA1 promoter. Interestingly, in a sir4 deletion strain, repression of CHA1 is partly lost and activator-independent remodeling of nuc-1 is observed. We propose a model for CHA1 activation based on promoter remodeling through interactions of Cha4p with chromatin components other than basal factors and associated proteins.",PMID: 9774346 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,

Previous work has provided evidence that in the budding yeasts Kluyveromyces lactis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the telomeric double-stranded DNA binding protein Rap1p negatively regulates telomere length, in part by nucleating, by its C-terminal tail, a higher-order DNA binding protein complex that presumably limits access of telomerase to the chromosome end. Here we show that in K. lactis, truncating the Rap1p C-terminal tail (Rap1p-DeltaC mutant) accelerates telomeric repeat turnover in the distal region of the telomere. In addition, combining the rap1-DeltaC mutation with a telomerase template mutation (ter1-kpn), which directs the addition of mutated telomeric DNA repeats to telomeres, synergistically caused an immediate loss of telomere length regulation. Capping of the unregulated telomeres of these double mutants with functionally wild-type repeats restored telomere length control.

Both internal loops in the 5' domain are essential for Prp8p to associate with the snRNP, but the conserved loop 1 is not, although this is the region to which Prp8p crosslinks most strongly. The extensive contacts between Prp8p and the 5' stem-loop of U5 RNA support the hypothesis that, in spliceosomes, Prp8p stabilizes loop 1-exon interactions. Moreover, data showing that Prp8p contacts the exons even in the absence of loop 1 indicate that Prp8p may be the principal anchoring factor for exons in the spliceosome. This and the close proximity of the spliceosomal translocase, Snu114p, to U5 loop 1 and Prp8p support and extend the proposal that Snu114p mimics U5 loop 1 during a translocation event in the spliceosome.",PMID: 9769098 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

Mutations in the N terminus of the brome mosaic virus polymerase affect genetic RNA-RNA recombination.,"Figlerowicz M, Nagy PD, Tang N, Kao CC, Bujarski JJ.","Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, Poznan, Poland.","Previously, we have observed that mutations in proteins 1a and 2a, the two virally encoded components of the brome mosaic virus (BMV) replicase, can affect the frequency of recombination and the locations of RNA recombination sites (P. D. Nagy, A. Dzianott, P. Ahlquist, and J. J. Bujarski, J. Virol. 69:2547-2556, 1995; M. Figlerowicz, P. D. Nagy, and J. J. Bujarski, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:2073-2078, 1997). Also, it was found before that the N-terminal domain of 2a, the putative RNA polymerase protein, participates in the interactions between 1a and 2a (C. C. Kao, R. Quadt, R. P. Hershberger, and P. Ahlquist, J. Virol. 66:6322-6329, 1992; E. O'Reilly, J. Paul, and C. C. Kao, J. Virol. 71:7526-7532, 1997). In this work, we examine how mutations within the N terminus of 2a influence RNA recombination in BMV. Because of the likely electrostatic character of 1a-2a interactions, five 2a mutants, MF1 to MF5, were generated by replacing clusters of acidic amino acids with their neutral counterparts. MF2 and MF5 retained nearly wild-type levels of 1a-2a interaction and were infectious in Chenopodium quinoa. However, compared to that in wild-type virus, the frequency of nonhomologous recombination in both MF2 and MF5 was markedly decreased. Only in MF2 was the frequency of homologous recombination reduced and the occurrence of imprecise homologous recombination increased. In MF5 there was also a 3' shift in the positions of homologous crossovers. The observed effects of MF2 and MF5 reveal that the 2a N-terminal domain participates in different ways in homologous and in nonhomologous BMV RNA recombination. This work maps specific locations within the N terminus involved in 1a-2a interaction and in recombination and further suggests that the mechanisms of the two types of crossovers in BMV are different.",PMID: 9765466 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
A late mitotic regulatory network controlling cyclin destruction in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"Jaspersen SL, Charles JF, Tinker-Kulberg RL, Morgan DO.","Department of Physiology, University of California, San Francisco, California 94143-0444, USA.","Exit from mitosis requires the inactivation of mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase-cyclin complexes, primarily by ubiquitin-dependent cyclin proteolysis. Cyclin destruction is regulated by a ubiquitin ligase known as the anaphase-promoting complex (APC). In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, members of a large class of late mitotic mutants, including cdc15, cdc5, cdc14, dbf2, and tem1, arrest in anaphase with a phenotype similar to that of cells expressing nondegradable forms of mitotic cyclins. We addressed the possibility that the products of these genes are components of a regulatory network that governs cyclin proteolysis. We identified a complex array of genetic interactions among these mutants and found that the growth defect in most of the mutants is suppressed by overexpression of SPO12, YAK1, and SIC1 and is exacerbated by overproduction of the mitotic cyclin Clb2. When arrested in late mitosis, the mutants exhibit a defect in cyclin-specific APC activity that is accompanied by high Clb2 levels and low levels of the anaphase inhibitor Pds1. Mutant cells arrested in G1 contain normal APC activity. We conclude that Cdc15, Cdc5, Cdc14, Dbf2, and Tem1 cooperate in the activation of the APC in late mitosis but are not required for maintenance of that activity in G1.",PMID: 9763445 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
"The role of glucosidase I (Cwh41p) in the biosynthesis of cell wall beta-1,6-glucan is indirect.","Abeijon C, Chen LY.","Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, Boston University-Goldman School of Dental Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02118, USA. cabeijon@bu.edu","CWH41, a gene involved in the assembly of cell wall beta-1,6-glucan, has recently been shown to be the structural gene for Saccharomyces cerevisiae glucosidase I that is responsible for initiating the trimming of terminal alpha-1,2-glucose residue in the N-glycan processing pathway. To distinguish between a direct or indirect role of Cwh41p in the biosynthesis of beta-1,6-glucan, we constructed a double mutant, alg5Delta (lacking dolichol-P-glucose synthase) cwh41Delta, and found that it has the same phenotype as the alg5Delta single mutant. It contains wild-type levels of cell wall beta-1,6-glucan, shows moderate underglycosylation of N-linked glycoproteins, and grows at concentrations of Calcofluor White (which interferes with cell wall assembly) that are lethal to cwh41Delta single mutant. The strong genetic interactions of CWH41 with KRE6 and KRE1, two other genes involved in the beta-1,6-glucan biosynthetic pathway, disappear in the absence of dolichol-P-glucose synthase (alg5Delta). The triple mutant alg5Deltacwh41Deltakre6Delta is viable, whereas the double mutant cwh41Deltakre6Delta in the same genetic background is not. The severe slow growth phenotype and 75% reduction in cell wall beta-1,6-glucan, characteristic of the cwh41Deltakre1Delta double mutant, are not observed in the triple mutant alg5Deltacwh41Deltakre1Delta. Kre6p, a putative Golgi glucan synthase, is unstable in cwh41Delta strains, and its overexpression renders these cells Calcofluor White resistant. These results demonstrate that the role of glucosidase I (Cwh41p) in the biosynthesis of cell wall beta-1,6-glucan is indirect and that dolichol-P-glucose is not an intermediate in this pathway.",PMID: 9763440 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Characterization of the kinetochore binding domain of CENP-E reveals interactions with the kinetochore proteins CENP-F and hBUBR1.,"Chan GK, Schaar BT, Yen TJ.","Institute for Cancer Research, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19111, USA.","We have identified a 350-amino acid domain in the kinetochore motor CENP-E that specifies kinetochore binding in mitosis but not during interphase. The kinetochore binding domain was used in a yeast two-hybrid screen to isolate interacting proteins that included the kinetochore proteins CENP-E, CENP-F, and hBUBR1, a BUB1-related kinase that was found to be mutated in some colorectal carcinomas (Cahill, D.P., C. Lengauer, J. Yu, G.J. Riggins, J.K. Wilson, S.D. Markowitz, K.W. Kinzler, and B. Vogelstein. 1998. Nature. 392:300-303). CENP-F, hBUBR1, and CENP-E assembled onto kinetochores in sequential order during late stages of the cell cycle. These proteins therefore define discrete steps along the kinetochore assembly pathway. Kinetochores of unaligned chromosome exhibited stronger hBUBR1 and CENP-E staining than those of aligned chromosomes. CENP-E and hBUBR1 remain colocalized at kinetochores until mid-anaphase when hBUBR1 localized to portions of the spindle midzone that did not overlap with CENP-E. As CENP-E and hBUBR1 can coimmunoprecipitate with each other from HeLa cells, they may function as a motor-kinase complex at kinetochores. However, the complex distribution pattern of hBUBR1 suggests that it may regulate multiple functions that include the kinetochore and the spindle midzone.",PMID: 9763420 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Kinetics of dimerization and interactions of p13suc1 with cyclin-dependent kinases.,"Morris MC, Heitz F, Divita G.","Centre de Recherches de Biochimie Macromoleculaire, CNRS, Montpellier, France.","The impact of p13suc1 on the conformation and regulation of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) and cyclins was investigated by spectroscopic and rapid kinetic approaches. In the absence of phosphorylation on cdks, p13suc1 formed stable complexes, mainly stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, specifically with cdk2 and cdc2. The presence of cyclin A, associated with cdk2 or cdc2, increased the stability of the interaction between cdk2 and p13suc1 by a factor of 2. However, cyclin A did not modify the association rate of p13suc1 to cdk2, but the dissociation rate, which was decreased 3-fold. Moreover, binding of p13suc1 to cdk2 resulted in a 2-fold decrease in the release of nucleotide from cdk2, indicating that p13suc1 induces a marked change in the structure of the nucleotide binding site of cdks. On the basis of the structure of cdk2/CksHs1 complex and on our kinetic results, we propose that the binding of Cks proteins to C-lobe of cdk2 is stabilized by the presence of cyclin A and that it may modify the orientation of the loop carrying residues 14 and 15 and their consequent access for dephosphorylation by cdc25 phosphatases. Finally, we have shown that dimerization of p13suc1 in the presence of zinc abolishes its interaction with cdks, which suggests that the binding of p13suc1 to cdk2 or cdk2/cyclin A may be regulated by dimerization of p13suc1 in vivo.",PMID: 9760264 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
Accumulation of mitochondrially synthesized Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cox2p and Cox3p depends on targeting information in untranslated portions of their mRNAs.,"Sanchirico ME, Fox TD, Mason TL.","Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and The Graduate Program in Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003-4505, USA.","The essential products of the yeast mitochondrial translation system are seven hydrophobic membrane proteins and Var1p, a hydrophilic protein in the small ribosomal subunit. Translation of the membrane proteins depends on nuclearly encoded, mRNA-specific translational activators that recognize the 5'-untranslated leaders of their target mRNAs. These translational activators are themselves membrane associated and could therefore tether translation to the inner membrane. In this study, we tested whether chimeric mRNAs with the untranslated sequences normally present on the mRNA encoding soluble Var1p, can direct functional expression of coding sequences specifying the integral membrane proteins Cox2p and Cox3p. DNA sequences specifying these chimeric mRNAs were inserted into mtDNA at the VAR1 locus and expressed in strains containing a nuclearly localized plasmid that supplies a functional form of Var1p, imported from the cytoplasm. Although cells expressing these chimeric mRNAs actively synthesized both membrane proteins, they were severely deficient in cytochrome c oxidase activity and in the accumulation of Cox2p and Cox3p, respectively. These data strongly support the physiological importance of interactions between membrane-bound mRNA-specific translational activators and the native 5'-untranslated leaders of the COX2 and COX3 mRNAs for localizing productive synthesis of Cox2p and Cox3p to the inner membrane.",PMID: 9755179 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

Polyclonal antibodies raised against the Rad9 protein recognized several polypeptides in asynchronous cultures, and in cells arrested in S or G2/M phases while a single form was observed in G1-arrested cells. Treatment with various DNA damaging agents, i.e. UV, ionizing radiation or methyl methane sulfonate, resulted in the appearance of hypermodified forms of the protein. All modifications detected during a normal cell cycle and after DNA damage were sensitive to phosphatase treatment, indicating that they resulted from phosphorylation. Damage-induced hyperphosphorylation of Rad9 correlated with checkpoint functions (cell-cycle arrest and transcriptional induction) and was cell-cycle stage- and progression-independent. In asynchronous cultures, Rad9 hyperphosphorylation was dependent on MEC1 and TEL1, homologues of the ATR and ATM genes. In G1-arrested cells, damage-dependent hyperphosphorylation required functional MEC1 in addition to RAD17, RAD24, MEC3 and DDC1, demonstrating cell-cycle stage specificity of the checkpoint genes in this response to DNA damage.

While the MyoD family members are able to initiate the skeletal muscle differentiation program, whether MEF2 is sufficient in directing skeletal muscle differentiation is still controversial. Furthermore, how MEF2 transactivates its target genes is not fully understood. It has been suggested that the interactions of MEF2 with other factors modify its transcriptional activity. Therefore, the identification of MEF2-interacting factors may be important in understanding the mechanism by which MEF2 activates its target genes. In this study, a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase), ERK5/BMK1 was found to interact with MEF2 in a yeast two hybrid screen. The interaction was confirmed by a glutathione S -transferase-pull down assay and a co-immunoprecipitation study indicating that endogenous ERK5 and MEF2 interact with each other in vivo . The interacting domain of MEF2 was mapped to the N-terminus which contains the highly conserved MADS and MEF2 domains. Functionally, ERK5/BMK1 was able to phosphorylate MEF2 in vitro .

Like their Drosophila counterparts, most mammalian RD proteins terminate in a common pentapeptide, VWRPY, which serves to recruit the corepressor Groucho (Gro). Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, in vitro association and pull-down experiments, we demonstrate that Gro and its mammalian homolog TLE1 specifically interact with AML1 and AML2. In addition to the VWRPY motif, other C-terminal sequences are required for these interactions with Gro/TLE1. TLE1 inhibits AML1-dependent transactivation of the T cell receptor (TCR) enhancers alpha and beta, which contain functional AML binding sites, in transfected Jurkat T cells. LEF-1 is an additional transcription factor that mediates transactivation of TCR enhancers. LEF-1 and its Drosophila homolog Pangolin (Pan) are involved in the Wnt/Wg signaling pathway through interactions with the coactivator beta-catenin and its highly conserved fly homolog Armadillo (Arm). We show that TLE/Gro interacts with LEF-1 and Pan, and inhibits LEF-1:beta-catenin-dependent transcription.

END5 encodes a proline-rich protein (End5p or verprolin) required for a polarised cortical actin cytoskeleton and endocytosis [2,3]. End5p interacts with actin [4], but its exact function is not yet known. To help elucidate End5p function, we sought other End5p-interacting proteins and identified the LAS17/BEE1 gene (encoding the yeast homologue of the human Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein, WASp) as a high-copy-number suppressor of the temperature-sensitive growth and endocytic defects of end5-1 cells (carrying a frameshift mutation affecting the last 213 residues of End5p). LAS17 is unable to suppress a full deletion of END5 (end5 delta), however, suggesting that the defective End5-1p in end5-1 mutants may be stabilised by Las17p. The amino terminus of Las17p interacts with the carboxyl terminus of End5p in the yeast two-hybrid system and similar interactions have been shown between WASp and a mammalian End5p homologue, WASp-interacting protein (WIP) [5]. As las17 delta deletion mutants are blocked in endocytosis, we conclude that Las17p and End5p interact and are essential for endocytosis."

We show that expression of the N- and C-terminal-encoding halves of SIR3 in trans partially complements the mating defect of the sir3 null allele, suggesting that the two domains have distinct functions. We present here a functional characterization of these domains. The N-terminal domain (Sir3N) increases both the frequency and extent of telomere-proximal silencing when expressed ectopically in SIR+ yeast strains, although we are unable to detect interaction between this domain and any known components of the silencing machinery. In contrast to its effect at telomeres, Sir3N overexpression derepresses transcription of reporter genes inserted in the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) array. Immunolocalization of Sir3N-GFP and Sir2p suggests that Sir3N directly antagonizes nucleolar Sir2p, releasing an rDNA-bound population of Sir2p so that it can enhance repression at telomeres. Overexpression of the C-terminal domain of either Sir3p or Sir4p has a dominant-negative effect on telomeric silencing. In strains overexpressing the C-terminal domain of Sir4p, elevated expression of either full-length Sir3p or Sir3N restores repression and the punctate pattern of Sir3p and Rap1p immunostaining. The similarity of Sir3N and Sir3p overexpression phenotypes suggests that Sir3N acts as an allosteric effector of Sir3p, either enhancing its interactions with other silencing components or liberating the full-length protein from nonfunctional complexes."

In vitro, Fip1 blocks access of the RNA primer to an RNA binding site (RBS) that overlaps the Fip1 carboxy-terminal interaction region and, in doing so, shifts PAP to a distributive mode of action. Partial truncation of this RBS has the same effect, indicating that this site is required for processivity. A comparison of the utilization of ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides as substrates indicates the existence on PAP of a second RBS which recognizes the last three nucleotides at the 3' end of the primer. This site discriminates against deoxyribonucleotides at the 3' end, and interactions at this site are not affected by Fip1. Further analysis revealed that the specificity of PAP for adenosine is not simply a function of the ATP binding site but also reflects interactions with bases at the 3' end of the primer and at another contact site 14 nucleotides upstream of the 3' end. These results suggest that the unique specificity of PAP for ribose and base, and thus the extent and type of activity with different substrates, depends on interactions at multiple nucleotide binding sites."

A., Severo Ochoa 2, 28760 Tres Cantos, Spain.","Sordarin derivatives are remarkably selective inhibitors of fungal protein synthesis.

It is RPP0, encoding the essential protein of the large ribosomal subunit stalk rpP0. Resistant mutants are found to retain most of the binding capacity for the drug, indicating that mutations in rpP0 endow the ribosome with the capacity to perform translation elongation in the presence of the inhibitor. Other proteins of the ribosomal stalk influence the expression of resistance, pointing to a wealth of interactions between stalk components and elongation factors. The involvement of multiple elements of the translation machinery in the mode of action of sordarin antifungals may explain the large selectivity of these compounds, even though the individual target components are highly conserved proteins."

Here we cloned and sequenced the suppressor allele of one such gene, and found it to be a missense mutation of the MRS2 gene (MRS2-L232F). The MRS2 gene was first implicated in group II intron splicing by the finding that overexpression of the wild-type gene weakly suppresses the splicing defect of a mutation of another intron. Tetrad analysis showed that independently isolated suppressors of two other domain 5 mutations are also allelles of the MRS2 gene and DNA sequencing identified a new missense mutation in each strain (MRS2-T230I and MRS2-L213M). All three suppressor mutations cause a temperature-sensitive respiration defect that is dominant negative in heterozygous diploids, but those strains splice the mutant intron at the elevated temperature. The three mutations are in a domain of the protein that is likely to be a helix-turn-helix region, so that effects of the mutations on protein-protein interactions may contribute to these phenotypes. These mutations suppress the splicing defect of many, but not all, of the available splicing defective mutations of aI5gamma, including mutations of several intron domains. Protein and RNA blot experiments show that the level of the protein encoded by the MRS2 gene, but not the mRNA, is elevated by these mutations. Interestingly, overexpression of the wild-type protein restores much lower levels of splicing than were obtained with similar elevated levels of the mutated Mrs2 proteins. The splicing phenotypes of these strains suggest a direct role for Mrs2 protein on group II intron splicing, but an indirect effect is not yet ruled out. Copyright 1998 Academic Press."

ArgRS is composed predominantly of alpha-helices and can be divided into five domains, including the class I-specific active site. The N-terminal domain shows striking similarity to some completely unrelated proteins and defines a module which should participate in specific tRNA recognition. The C-terminal domain, which is the putative anticodon-binding module, displays an all-alpha-helix fold highly similar to that of Escherichia coli methionyl-tRNA synthetase. While ArgRS requires tRNAArg for the first step of the aminoacylation reaction, the results show that its presence is not a prerequisite for L-arginine binding. All H-bond-forming capability of L-arginine is used by the protein for the specific recognition. The guanidinium group forms two salt bridge interactions with two acidic residues, and one H-bond with a tyrosine residue; these three residues are strictly conserved in all ArgRS sequences. This tyrosine is also conserved in other class I aaRS active sites but plays several functional roles. The ArgRS structure allows the definition of a new framework for sequence alignments and subclass definition in class I aaRSs."

Herein we describe the use of the two genetic approaches, the lambda repressor fusion and the yeast two-hybrid systems, to detect and analyze homo- and heterotypic interactions with PKR. We also describe several biochemical methodologies commonly used in our laboratory to validate the genetic results. Although the examples in this article focus on PKR, the techniques can easily be adapted to investigate protein-protein associations in a variety of experimental systems. Finally, given the important role of PKR as a mediator of IFN-induced antiviral and antiproliferative effects, these studies may provide clues to the development of reagents that target PKR to enhance the therapeutic use of IFN in the treatment of disease.

To understand how DNA replication is regulated through PCNA, elucidation of the precise mechanisms of these protein interactions is necessary. RESULTS: Loop-region mutants in which human PCNA sequences were substituted with the corresponding Saccharomyces cerevisiae PCNA regions were prepared. Analysis of their functions, along with previously prepared alanine scanning mutants, demonstrated that some loops interact with DNA polymerase delta (pol delta) and replication factor C (RFC). The p21 binding sites of PCNA, mapped by affinity measurement of the mutant forms, found to be located within a distinct structure of the PCNA monomer, overlap with RFC- and pol delta-interaction sites. Competition between p21 and pol delta or RFC for binding to PCNA results in efficient inhibition of its stimulation of pol delta DNA synthesis and RFC ATPase but not of PCNA loading on DNA by RFC. CONCLUSIONS: Semi-saturated amounts of p21 selectively block formation of the active pol delta complex but not the RFC-PCNA complex at 3'-ends of DNA primers. This differential effect may explain the specific inhibition of DNA replication by p21."

We have attempted to identify specific biological phenomena linked to a particular domain of a TAF by analysing domain-exchanged chimeric mutants between Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Sp) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) counterparts. RESULTS: Contrary to the case of TBP, Sp TAF containing the WD40 repeat cannot be exchanged for its Sc counterpart, despite their highly conserved primary structures. This 'species-specific' function locates in the N-terminal region. The C-terminal region, largely consisting of the WD40 repeat, is exchangeable for the corresponding region of its Sc counterpart. Growth of the strain harbouring this C-terminal chimeric mutant is temperature-sensitive. The chimeric gene product did not disappear at a restrictive temperature, a finding which strongly suggests that the growth defect is caused by an aberration in the interactions through the WD40 repeat structural motif. With temperature elevation, the chimeric mutants underwent drastic morphological changes due to a defect in cytokinesis. CONCLUSIONS: The WD40 repeat of TAF is primarily involved in reactions which might regulate cytokinesis in Sp."

The primary function of Tax is to transcriptionally activate the HTLV-1 promoter, but Tax is also known to stimulate expression of cellular genes. It has been reported to associate with several transcription factors, as well as proteins not involved in transcription. To better characterize potential cellular targets of Tax present in infected cells, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae two-hybrid screening was performed with a cDNA library constructed from the HTLV-1-infected MT2 cell line. From this study, we found 158 positive clones representing seven different cDNAs. We focused our attention on the cDNA encoding the transcription factor CREB-2. CREB-2 is an unconventional member of the ATF/CREB family in that it lacks a protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation site and has been reported to negatively regulate transcription from the cyclic AMP response element of the human enkephalin promoter. In this study, we demonstrate that CREB-2 cooperates with Tax to enhance viral transcription and that its basic-leucine zipper C-terminal domain is required for both in vitro and in vivo interactions with Tax. Our results confirm that the activation of the HTLV-1 promoter through Tax and factors of the ATF/CREB family is PKA independent."

Small positive and negative charges adjacent to the transmembrane segment had equal and opposite effects on orientation, and this effect was independent of N- or C-terminal location, consistent with a purely electrostatic interaction with response mechanisms. A 3:1 bias toward Nexo insertion, observed in the absence of a charge difference, was shown to reflect the Nexo bias conferred by longer transmembrane segments. Orientation correlated best with total hydrophobicity rather than length, but it was also strongly affected by the distribution of hydrophobicity within the transmembrane segment. The most hydrophobic terminus was preferentially translocated. Insertion orientation thus depends on integration of responses to at least three parameters: charge difference across a transmembrane segment, its total hydrophobicity, and its hydrophobicity gradient. Relative signal strengths were estimated, and consequences for topology prediction are discussed. Responses to transmembrane sequence may depend on protein-translocon interactions, but responses to charge difference may be mediated by the electrostatic field provided by anionic phospholipids."

The assay is based upon the measurement of the catalytic activity of an active site mutant of type III chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CATIII) expressed in S. cerevisiae. A His195(CAC)-->Tyr195(UAC) mutant of CATIII is completely inactive, but catalytic activity can be restored by misincorporation of histidine at the mutant UAC codon. The average error frequency of misincorporation of histidine at this tyrosine UAC codon in wild-type yeast strains was measured as 0. 5x10(-5) and this frequency was increased some 50-fold by growth in the presence of paromomycin, a known translational-error-inducing antibiotic. A detectable frequency of misincorporation of histidine at a mutant Ala195 GCU codon was also measured as 2x10(-5), but in contrast to the Tyr195-->His195 misincorporation event, the frequency of histidine misincorporation at Ala195 GCU was not increased by paromomycin, inferring that this error did not result from miscognate codon-anticodon interaction. The His195 to Tyr195 missense error assay was used to demonstrate increased frequencies of missense error at codon 195 in SUP44 and SUP46 mutants. These two mutants have previously been shown to exhibit a translation termination error phenotype and the sup44+ and sup46+ genes encode the yeast ribosomal proteins S4 and S9, respectively. These data represent the first accurate in vivo measurement of a specific mistranslation event in a eukaryotic cell and directly confirm that the eukaryotic ribosome plays an important role in controlling missense errors arising from non-cognate codon-anticodon interactions.

Surprisingly, the isoenzymes in fungi (ERG2p) and vertebrates [emopamil binding protein (EBP)] are structurally completely unrelated, whereas the sigma1 receptor, a mammalian protein of unknown function, bears significant similarity with the yeast ERG2p. Here, we compare the drug binding properties of SIs and related proteins with [3H]ifenprodil as a common high affinity radioligand (Kd = 1.4-19 nM), demonstrating an intimate pharmacological relationship among ERG2p, sigma1 receptor, and EBP. This renders SIs a remarkable example for structurally diverse enzymes with similar pharmacological profiles and the propensity to bind drugs from different chemical groups with high affinity. We identified a variety of experimental drugs with nanomolar affinity for the human EBP (Ki = 0.5-14 nM) such as MDL28815, AY9944, triparanol, and U18666A. These compounds, as well as the fungicide tridemorph and the clinically used drugs tamoxifen, clomiphene, amiodarone, and opipramol, inhibit the in vitro activity of the recombinant human EBP (IC50 = 0.015-54 microM). The high affinity of the human EBP for 3H-tamoxifen (Kd = 3 +/- 2 nM) implies that the EBP carries the previously described microsomal antiestrogen binding site. Interactions of the EBP with structurally diverse lipophilic amines suggest that novel compounds of related structure should be counterscreened for inhibition of the enzyme to avoid interference with sterol Delta8-Delta7 isomerization."

RPA homologues have been identified in all eukaryotes examined. All homologues are heterotrimeric complexes with subunits of approximately 70, approximately 32, and approximately 14 kDa. While RPA homologues are evolutionarily conserved, they are not functionally equivalent. To gain a better understanding of the functional differences between RPA homologues, we analyzed the DNA-binding parameters of RPA from human cells and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (hRPA and scRPA, respectively). Both yeast and human RPA bind ssDNA with high affinity and low cooperativity. However, scRPA has a larger occluded binding site (45 nucleotides versus 34 nucleotides) and a higher affinity for oligothymidine than hRPA. Mutant forms of hRPA and scRPA containing the high-affinity DNA-binding domain from the 70-kDa subunit had nearly identical DNA binding properties. In contrast, subcomplexes of the 32- and 14-kDa subunits from both yeast and human RPA had weak ssDNA binding activity. However, the binding constants for the yeast and human subcomplexes were 3 and greater than 6 orders of magnitude lower than those for the RPA heterotrimer, respectively. We conclude that differences in the activity of the 32- and 14-kDa subunits of RPA are responsible for variations in the ssDNA-binding properties of scRPA and hRPA. These data also indicate that hRPA and scRPA have different modes of binding to ssDNA, which may contribute to the functional disparities between the two proteins."

"Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis controls the abundance of many cell cycle regulatory proteins. Recent work in Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggests that a complex consisting of Cdc53, Skp1, and a third component known as an F-box protein (termed SCF) in combination with Cdc34 specifically targets regulatory proteins for degradation, and that substrate specificity is likely to be mediated by the F-box subunit. A screen for genetic interactions with a cdc34 mutation yielded MET30, which encodes an F-box protein. MET30 is an essential gene required for cell cycle progression and met30 mutations interact genetically with mutations in SCF components. Furthermore, physical interactions between Met30, Cdc53, Cdc34, and Skp1 in vivo provide evidence for an SCFMet30 complex. We demonstrate the involvement of Met30 in the degradation of the Cdk-inhibitory kinase Swe1. Swe1 is stabilized in met30 mutants and GST-Met30 pull-down experiments reveal that Met30 specifically binds Swe1 in vivo. Furthermore, extracts prepared from cdc34 or met30 mutants are defective in polyubiquitination of Swe1. Taken together, these data suggest that SCF-mediated proteolysis may contribute to the regulation of entry into mitosis. Our data, in combination with previously published results, also provide evidence for distinct SCF complexes in vivo and support the idea that their F-box subunits mediate SCF substrate specificity.",PMID: 9716410 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,942: Genes Dev  1998 Aug 15;12(16):2574-86 ,Telomere-mediated chromosome pairing during meiosis in budding yeast.
"Certain haploid strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae can undergo meiosis, but meiotic prophase progression and subsequent nuclear division are delayed if these haploids carry an extra chromosome (i. e., are disomic). Observations indicate that interactions between homologous chromosomes cause a delay in meiotic prophase, perhaps to allow time for interhomolog interactions to be completed. Analysis of meiotic mutants demonstrates that the relevant aspect of homolog recognition is independent of meiotic recombination and synaptonemal complex formation. A disome in which the extra chromosome is circular sporulates without a delay, indicating that telomeres are important for homolog recognition. Consistent with this hypothesis, fluorescent in situ hybridization demonstrates that a circular chromosome has a reduced capacity to pair with its homolog, and a telomere-associated meiotic protein (Ndj1) is required to delay sporulation in disomes. A circular dimer containing two copies of the same chromosome delays meiosis to the same extent as two linear homologs, implying that physical proximity bypasses the requirement for telomeres in homolog pairing. Analysis of a disome carrying two linear permuted chromosomes suggests that even nonhomologous chromosome ends can promote homolog pairing to a limited extent. We speculate that telomere-mediated chromosome movement and/or telomere clustering promote homolog pairing.",PMID: 9716409 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,943: Biochim Biophys Acta  1998 Aug 10;1366(1-2):127-37 ,Bcl-2 family proteins and mitochondria.

Cytoprotective Bcl-2 family proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL prevent mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening and release of apoptogenic proteins from mitochondria under many circumstances that would otherwise result in either apoptosis or necrosis. In contrast, some pro-apoptotic members of this family such as Bax can induce these destructive changes in mitochondria in both mammalian cells and when expressed exogenously in yeast. The mechanisms by which Bcl-2 family proteins control cell life and death remain elusive, but may include both the ability to form ion channels or pores in membranes and physical interactions with a variety of proteins implicated in apoptosis regulation.",PMID: 9714773 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,944: J Biol Chem  1998 Aug 28;273(35):22589-94 ,"Yeast transcript elongation factor (TFIIS), structure and function.

"TFIIS is a general transcription elongation factor that helps arrested RNA polymerase II elongation complexes resume transcription. We have previously shown that yeast TFIIS (yTFIIS) comprises three structural domains (I-III). The three-dimensional structures of domain II and part of domain III have been previously reported, but neither domain can autonomously stimulate transcription elongation. Here we report the NMR structural analysis of residues 131-309 of yTFIIS which retains full activity and contains all of domains II and III. We confirm that the structure of domain II in the context of fully active yTFIIS is the same as that determined previously for a shorter construct. We have determined the structure of the C-terminal zinc ribbon domain of active yTFIIS and shown that it is similar to that reported for a shorter construct of human TFIIS. The region linking domain II with the zinc ribbon of domain III appears to be conformationally flexible and does not adopt a single defined tertiary structure.

"The protein tyrosine kinase p59fyn (Fyn) plays important roles in both lymphocyte Ag receptor signaling and cytokinesis of proB cells. We utilized yeast two-hybrid cloning to identify the product of the tctex-1 gene as a protein that specifically interacts with Fyn, but not with other Src family kinases. Tctex-1 was recently identified as a component of the dynein cytoskeletal motor complex. The capacity of a Tctex-1-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein to effectively bind Fyn from cell lysates confirmed the authenticity of this interaction. Tctex-1 binding required the first 19 amino acids of Fyn and integrity of two lysine residues within this sequence that were previously shown to be important for Fyn interactions with the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) of lymphocyte Ag receptors. Expression of tctex-1 mRNA and protein was observed in all lymphoma lines analyzed, and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy localized the protein to the perinuclear region. Analysis of a T cell hybridoma revealed prominent colocalization of Tctex-1 and Fyn at the cleavage furrow and mitotic spindles in cells undergoing cytokinesis. Our results provide a unique insight into a mechanism by which Tctex-1 might mediate specific recruitment of Fyn to the dynein complex in lymphocytes, which may be a critical event in mediating the previously defined role of Fyn in cytokinesis.",PMID: 9712037 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,946: Mol Cell Biol  1998 Sep;18(9):5392-403 ,High-resolution structural analysis of chromatin at specific loci: Saccharomyces cerevisiae silent mating type locus HMLalpha.
"Genetic studies have suggested that chromatin structure is involved in repression of the silent mating type loci in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Chromatin mapping at nucleotide resolution of the transcriptionally silent HMLalpha and the active MATalpha shows that unique organized chromatin structure characterizes the silent state of HMLalpha. Precisely positioned nucleosomes abutting the silencers extend over the alpha1 and alpha2 coding regions. The HO endonuclease recognition site, nuclease hypersensitive at MATalpha, is protected at HMLalpha. Although two precisely positioned nucleosomes incorporate transcription start sites at HMLalpha, the promoter region of the alpha1 and alpha2 genes is nucleosome free and more nuclease sensitive in the repressed than in the transcribed locus. Mutations in genes essential for HML silencing disrupt the nucleosome array near HML-I but not in the vicinity of HML-E, which is closer to the telomere of chromosome III. At the promoter and the HO site, the structure of HMLalpha in Sir protein and histone H4 N-terminal deletion mutants is identical to that of the transcriptionally active MATalpha. The discontinuous chromatin structure of HMLalpha contrasts with the continuous array of nucleosomes found at repressed a-cell-specific genes and the recombination enhancer. Punctuation at HMLalpha may be necessary for higher-order structure or karyoskeleton interactions. The unique chromatin architecture of HMLalpha may relate to the combined requirements of transcriptional repression and recombinational competence.",PMID: 9710623 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,947: Mol Cell Biol  1998 Sep;18(9):5308-19 ,"Vam7p, a SNAP-25-like molecule, and Vam3p, a syntaxin homolog, function together in yeast vacuolar protein trafficking."
"A genetic screen to isolate gene products required for vacuolar morphogenesis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae identified VAM7, a gene which encodes a protein containing a predicted coiled-coil domain homologous to the coiled-coil domain of the neuronal t-SNARE, SNAP-25 (Y.

Analysis of a temperature-sensitive-for-function (tsf) allele of VAM7 (vam7(tsf)) demonstrated that the VAM7 gene product directly functions in vacuolar protein transport. vam7(tsf) mutant cells incubated at the nonpermissive temperature displayed rapid defects in the delivery of multiple proteins that traffic to the vacuole via distinct biosynthetic pathways. Examination of vam7(tsf) cells at the nonpermissive temperature by electron microscopy revealed the accumulation of aberrant membranous compartments that may represent unfused transport intermediates. A fraction of Vam7p was localized to vacuolar membranes. Furthermore, VAM7 displayed genetic interactions with the vacuolar syntaxin homolog, VAM3. Consistent with the genetic results, Vam7p physically associated in a complex containing Vam3p, and this interaction was enhanced by inactivation of the yeast NSF (N-ethyl maleimide-sensitive factor) homolog, Sec18p. In addition to the coiled-coil domain, Vam7p also contains a putative NADPH oxidase p40(phox) (PX) domain. Changes in two conserved amino acids within this domain resulted in synthetic phenotypes when combined with the vam3(tsf) mutation, suggesting that the PX domain is required for Vam7p function. This study provides evidence for the functional and physical interaction between Vam7p and Vam3p at the vacuolar membrane, where they function as part of a t-SNARE complex required for the docking and/or fusion of multiple transport intermediates destined for the vacuole.",PMID: 9710615 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,948: Mol Cell Biol  1998 Sep;18(9):5189-98 ,"Genetic, physical, and functional interactions between the triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase components of the yeast mRNA capping apparatus."
"We have characterized an essential Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene, CES5, that when present in high copy, suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth defect caused by the ceg1-25 mutation of the yeast mRNA guanylyltransferase (capping enzyme). CES5 is identical to CET1, which encodes the RNA triphosphatase component of the yeast capping apparatus. Purified recombinant Cet1 catalyzes hydrolysis of the gamma phosphate of triphosphate-terminated RNA at a rate of 1 s-1. Cet1 is a monomer in solution; it binds with recombinant Ceg1 in vitro to form a Cet1-Ceg1 heterodimer. The interaction of Cet1 with Ceg1 elicits >10-fold stimulation of the guanylyltransferase activity of Ceg1. This stimulation is the result of increased affinity for the GTP substrate. A truncated protein, Cet1(201-549), has RNA triphosphatase activity, heterodimerizes with and stimulates Ceg1 in vitro, and suffices when expressed in single copy for cell growth in vivo. The more extensively truncated derivative Cet1(246-549) also has RNA triphosphatase activity but fails to stimulate Ceg1 in vitro and is lethal when expressed in single copy in vivo. These data suggest that the Cet1-Ceg1 interaction is essential but do not resolve whether the triphosphatase activity is also necessary. The mammalian capping enzyme Mce1 (a bifunctional triphosphatase-guanylyltransferase) substitutes for Cet1 in vivo. A mutation of the triphosphatase active-site cysteine of Mce1 is lethal. Hence, an RNA triphosphatase activity is essential for eukaryotic cell growth.

"PURPOSE: Retinal phosducin (Phd) and phosducin-like protein 1 (PhLP1) selectively bind G-protein beta/gamma subunits (Gbetagamma). Our laboratory has recently identified two phosducin-like orphan proteins (PhLOP1 and PhLOP2) that lack the ability to interact with Gbetagamma. In search of potential functional protein partner(s) for these phosducin orphans, we examined their protein-protein interactions using a yeast two-hybrid screen. METHODS: A bovine retina yeast expression cDNA library was screened with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (BD) fusion of PhLOP1. Quantitative analysis of the selected positives with PhLOP1 and other Phd isoforms was assessed by growth and beta-galactosidase activity. Further molecular, biochemical, and immunological detection methods utilizing glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Phd isoform fusion proteins and the potential partner were also performed. RESULTS: A member of the superfamily of putative ATPases was selected in the yeast two hybrid screen. Further characterization identified a direct interaction of this putative ATPase with PhLOP1, as well as Phd and PhLP1, but not with PhLOP2. A database search verified this ATPase as a bovine orthologue of the yeast SUG1 (ySUG1), a putative transcriptional mediator and a subunit of the 26S proteasome complex. Our experiments reveal that the carboxy-terminus of PhLOP1 is essential for the protein-protein interaction with SUG1, but it alone is not sufficient to mediate SUG1 interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these experimental results, Phd, PhLP1 and PhLOP1 have protein-protein interaction with SUG1. PhLOP1, a truncated amino-terminal splice variant of Phd, is the best candidate for the interaction with SUG1 among the four Phd isoforms studied, which suggests a potential function for PhLOP1.",PMID: 9701609 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,951: Biochemistry  1998 Aug 11;37(32):11171-81 ,Structure determination and characterization of Saccharomyces cerevisiae profilin.
"The structure of profilin from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been determined by X-ray crystallography at 2.3 A resolution. The overall fold of yeast profilin is similar to the fold observed for other profilin structures. The interactions of yeast and human platelet profilins with rabbit skeletal muscle actin were characterized by titration microcalorimetry, fluorescence titrations, and nucleotide exchange kinetics. The affinity of yeast profilin for rabbit actin (2.9 microM) is approximately 30-fold weaker than the affinity of human platelet profilin for rabbit actin (0.1 microM), and the relative contributions of entropic and enthalpic terms to the overall free energy of binding are different for the two profilins. The titration of pyrene-labeled rabbit skeletal actin with human profilin yielded a Kd of 2.8 microM, similar to the Kd of 2.0 microM for the interaction between yeast profilin and pyrene-labeled yeast actin. The binding data are discussed in the context of the known crystal structures of profilin and actin, and the residues present at the actin-profilin interface. The affinity of yeast profilin for poly-L-proline was determined from fluorescence measurements and is similar to the reported affinity of Acanthamoeba profilin for poly-L-proline. Yeast profilin was shown to catalyze adenine nucleotide exchange from yeast actin almost 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than human profilin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin.

The subject of this paper is the application of a novel method to the genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The method applies to an important class of gene interactions, that is, transcriptional regulation via transcription factors (TFs) that bind to specific enhancer or silencer sites on DNA. The method addresses the question: which of the genes in a genome are likely to be regulated by one or more TFs with known DNA binding specificity? It takes advantage of the fact that many TFs show cooperativity in transcriptional activation which manifests itself in closely spaced TF binding sites. Such ""clusters"" of binding sites are very unlikely to occur by chance alone, as opposed to individual sites, which are often abundant both in the genome and in promoter regions. Statistical information about binding site clusters in the genome, can be complemented by information about (i) known biochemical functions of the TF, (ii) the structure of its binding site, and (iii) function of the genes near the cluster, to identify genes likely to be regulated by a given transcription factor. Previously, binding sites of well characterized transcription factors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were analyzed. Here, the method is applied to a somewhat different situation: the yeast DNA binding activity yE2F, similar to the mammalian transcription factor E2F. yE2F has a DNA binding specificity identical to E2F, and its binding site shows UAS activity in a GAL1-based promoter construct. However, despite its high conservation, the in vivo function of yE2F is unknown. The analysis carried out the here suggests candidate genes for regulation by yE2F.",PMID: 9697188 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,953: Cell  1998 Jul 24;94(2):217-27 ,Degradation signal masking by heterodimerization of MATalpha2 and MATa1 blocks their mutual destruction by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
"Proteolysis by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is often regulated, but the mechanisms underlying such regulation remain ill-defined. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cell type is controlled by the MAT transcription factors. The alpha2 repressor is a known ubiquitin pathway substrate in alpha haploid cells. We show that a1 is rapidly degraded in a haploids. In a/alpha diploids, alpha2 and a1 are stabilized by heterodimerization. Association depends on N-terminal coiled-coil interactions between a1 and alpha2. Residues in alpha2 important for these interactions overlap a critical determinant of an alpha2 degradation signal, which we delimit by extensive mutagenesis. Our data provide a detailed description of a natural ubiquitin-dependent degradation signal and point to a molecular mechanism for regulated turnover in which proteolytic signals are differentially masked in alternative multiprotein complexes.",PMID: 9695950 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,954: Mol Biol Cell  1998 Aug;9(8):2201-16 ,"A genetic analysis of interactions with Spc110p reveals distinct functions of Spc97p and Spc98p, components of the yeast gamma-tubulin complex."
"The spindle pole body (SPB) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae functions as the microtubule-organizing center. Spc110p is an essential structural component of the SPB and spans between the central and inner plaques of this multilamellar organelle. The amino terminus of Spc110p faces the inner plaque, the substructure from which spindle microtubules radiate. We have undertaken a synthetic lethal screen to identify mutations that enhance the phenotype of the temperature-sensitive spc110-221 allele, which encodes mutations in the amino terminus. The screen identified mutations in SPC97 and SPC98, two genes encoding components of the Tub4p complex in yeast. The spc98-63 allele is synthetic lethal only with spc110 alleles that encode mutations in the N terminus of Spc110p. In contrast, the spc97 alleles are synthetic lethal with spc110 alleles that encode mutations in either the N terminus or the C terminus. Using the two-hybrid assay, we show that the interactions of Spc110p with Spc97p and Spc98p are not equivalent. The N terminus of Spc110p displays a robust interaction with Spc98p in two different two-hybrid assays, while the interaction between Spc97p and Spc110p is not detectable in one strain and gives a weak signal in the other. Extra copies of SPC98 enhance the interaction between Spc97p and Spc110p, while extra copies of SPC97 interfere with the interaction between Spc98p and Spc110p. By testing the interactions between mutant proteins, we show that the lethal phenotype in spc98-63 spc110-221 cells is caused by the failure of Spc98-63p to interact with Spc110-221p. In contrast, the lethal phenotype in spc97-62 spc110-221 cells can be attributed to a decreased interaction between Spc97-62p and Spc98p. Together, these studies provide evidence that Spc110p directly links the Tub4p complex to the SPB. Moreover, an interaction between Spc98p and the amino-terminal region of Spc110p is a critical component of the linkage, whereas the interaction between Spc97p and Spc110p is dependent on Spc98p.",PMID: 9693376 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,955: J Endocrinol  1998 Jun;157(3):361-71 ,Post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms in eukaryotes: an overview.
"Expression of a gene can be controlled at many levels, including transcription, mRNA splicing, mRNA stability, translation and post-translational events such as protein stability and modification. The majority of studies to date have focused on transcriptional control mechanisms, but the importance of post-transcriptional mechanisms in regulating gene expression in eukaryotes is becoming increasingly clear. In this short review, selected examples of post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms operating in both lower and higher eukaryotes will be used to highlight the plethora of such mechanisms already identified. The underlying theme is that post-transcriptional gene regulation relies on specific RNA-protein interactions that either result in the targeted degradation of the mRNA or prevent access of the ribosome to the translation start codon. Such interactions can occur in the 5' or 3' untranslated regions of an mRNA or within the decoded portion of the molecule. The importance of these regulatory mechanisms in a range of biological systems is also illustrated.","Publication Types: Review Review, Academic",PMID: 9691970 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,,956: Genetics  1998 Aug;149(4):1717-27

Sro7p and Sro77p, a homologue of Sro7p, possess domains homologous to the protein that are encoded by the Drosophila tumor suppressor gene lethal (2) giant larvae [l(2)gl]. sro7Delta sro77Delta mutants showed a partial defect of organization of the polarized actin cytoskeleton and a cold-sensitive growth phenotype. A human counterpart of l(2)gl could suppress the sro7Delta sro77Delta defect. Similar to the l(2)gl protein, Sro7p formed a complex with Myo1p, a type II myosin. These results indicate that Sro7p and Sro77p are the yeast counterparts of the l(2)gl protein. Our genetic analysis revealed that deletion of SRO7 and SRO77 showed reciprocal suppression with deletion of MYO1 (i.e., the sro7Delta sro77Delta defect was suppressed by myo1Delta and vice versa). In addition, SRO7 showed genetic interactions with MYO2, encoding an essential type V myosin: Overexpression of SRO7 suppressed a defect in MYO2 and, conversely, overexpression of MYO2 suppressed the cold-sensitive phenotype of sro7Delta sro77Delta mutants. These results indicate that Sro7 function is closely related to both Myo1p and Myo2p.

"Department of Pharmacology, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.","The Rho-type GTPase Cdc42p has been implicated in diverse cellular functions including cell shape, cell motility, and cytokinesis, all of which involve the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Targets of Cdc42p that interface the actin cytoskeleton are likely candidates for mediating cellular activities. In this report, we identify and characterize a yeast homologue for the mammalian IQGAP, a cytoskeletal target for Cdc42p. The yeast IQGAP homologue, designated Iqg1p, displays a two-hybrid interaction with activated Cdc42p and coimmunoprecipitates with actin filaments. Deletion of IQG1 results in a temperature-sensitive lethality and causes aberrant morphologies including elongated and round multinucleated cells. This together with its localization at the mother-bud neck, suggest that Iqg1p promotes budding and cytokinesis. At restrictive temperatures, the vacuoles of the mutant cells enlarge and vesicles accumulate in the bud. Interestingly, Iqg1p shows two-hybrid interactions with the ankyrin repeat-containing protein, Akr1p (Kao, L.-R., J. Peterson, J. Ruiru, L. Bender, and A. Bender. 1996. Mol. Cell.

SR is a heterodimeric ER membrane protein whose subunits, SRalpha and SRbeta, are both members of the GTPase superfamily. Here we characterize a 27-kD protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (encoded by SRP102) as a homologue of mammalian SRbeta. This notion is supported (a) by Srp102p's sequence similarity to SRbeta; (b) by its disposition as an ER membrane protein; (c) by its interaction with Srp101p, the yeast SRalpha homologue; and (d) by its role in SRP-dependent protein targeting in vivo. The GTP-binding site in Srp102p is surprisingly insensitive to single amino acid substitutions that inactivate other GTPases. Multiple mutations in the GTP-binding site, however, inactivate Srp102p. Loss of activity parallels a loss of affinity between Srp102p and Srp101p, indicating that the interaction between SR subunits is important for function. Deleting the transmembrane domain of Srp102p, the only known membrane anchor in SR, renders SR soluble in the cytosol, which unexpectedly does not significantly impair SR function.

Jeggo PA.,"MRC Cell Mutation Unit, University of Sussex, Brighton, United Kingdom.","For many years it has been evident that mammalian cells differ dramatically from yeast and rejoin the majority of their DNA DSBs by a nonhomologous mechanism, recently termed NHEJ. In the last few years a number of genes and proteins have been identified that operate in the pathway providing insights into the mechanism. These proteins include the three components of DNA-PK, DNA ligase IV, and XRCC4. In yeast Sir2, -3, and -4 proteins are also involved in the process and therefore are likely to play a role in higher organisms. Studies with yeast suggest that NHEJ is an error-free mechanism. Although the process is far from understood, it is likely that the DNA-PK complex or Ku alone acts in a complex with the Sir proteins possibly protecting the ends and preventing random rejoining. Further work is required to establish the details of this mechanism and to determine whether this represents an accurate rejoining process for a complex break induced by ionizing radiation. It will be intriguing to discover how the cell achieves efficient and accurate rejoining without the use of homology. Interactions between the components of DNA-PK and other proteins playing a central role in damage response mechanisms are beginning to emerge. Interestingly, there is evidence that DNA repair and damage response mechanisms overlap in lower organisms. The overlapping defects of the yeast Ku mutants, tell mutants, and AT cell lines in telomere maintenance further suggest overlapping functions or interacting mechanisms. A challenge for the future will be to establish how these different damage response mechanisms overlap and interact.","Publication Types: Review Review, Academic",PMID: 9677708 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
A family of Arf effectors defined as suppressors of the loss of Arf function in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"Zhang CJ, Cavenagh MM, Kahn RA.","Department of Biochemistry, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322-3050, USA.","Arf proteins are ubiquitous, eukaryotic regulators of virtually every step of vesicular membrane traffic. ADP-ribosylation factors are essential in yeast and the lethality resulting from either overexpression or underexpression (deletion) of Arf genes has previously been ascribed to dysregulation of the secretory process. We have identified a family of four genes (Suppressors of Arf ts, SAT) as high copy suppressors of a loss of function allele of ARF1 (arf1-3). Those proteins with SAT activity were found to contain a minimal consensus motif, including a C2C2H2 cluster with a novel and specific spacing. Genetic interactions between members of this family and with ARF1 are consistent with each sharing a common cellular pathway. Included in this family is Gcs1, a protein previously described (Poon, P. P., Wang, X., Rotman, M., Huber, I., Cukierman, E., Cassel, D., Singer, R. A., and Johnston, G. C. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 10074-10077) to possess Arf GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity, demonstrating a direct interaction between Arf and at least one of these suppressors. The suppression of the loss of Arf function by overexpression of Gcs1 and demonstration of direct, preferential binding of Gcs1 to the activated form of Arf (Arf.GTP) lead us to conclude that the biological role of Gcs1 is as an effector of the essential function of Arf in mitotic growth, rather than a down-regulator as implied by the biochemical (Arf GAP) activity. Suppression of the growth defect of arf1(-3) cells was observed under conditions that did not alter the secretory defect associated with arf1(-) mutation, indicating that the essential role of Arf in eukaryotes can be distinguished from role(s) in the secretory pathway and appear to employ distinct pathways and effectors.",PMID: 9677411 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],
The C-terminal hydrophobic repeat of Schizosaccharomyces pombe heat shock factor is not required for heat-induced DNA-binding.,"Saltsman KA, Prentice HL, Kingston RE.","Department of Molecular Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston 02114, USA.","The C-terminal hydrophobic repeat (CTR) of heat shock transcription factor (HSF) has been proposed to regulate DNA binding by intramolecular interactions with the leucine zipper motifs present in the HSF trimerization domain. Schizosaccharomyces pombe provides a useful model organism for the study of the regulation of HSF DNA binding because, unlike Saccharomyces cerevisiae, S. pombe hsf is highly heat shock inducible for DNA binding and contains a clear homology to the CTR. We examined the role that the CTR plays in the regulation of S. pombe hsf by constructing isogenic strains bearing deletion and point mutations in the chromosomal copy of hsf. Surprisingly, we found that point mutation of key hydrophobic amino acids within the CTR, as well as full deletion of it, yielded factors that show normal binding at normal growth temperatures and full levels of heat-induced binding. Deletion of the CTR did, however, slightly lower the temperature required for maximal activation. In contrast, a large deletion of the C-terminus, which removes close to a third of the coding sequence, was deregulated and bound DNA at control temperature. Several of the deletion mutants were significantly reduced in their level of expression, yet they showed wild-type levels of DNA binding activity following heat shock. These experiments demonstrate that appropriate regulation of the DNA binding activity of S. pombe hsf is not solely dependent upon the CTR, and imply that a feedback mechanism exists that establishes proper levels of DNA binding following heat shock despite mutations that significantly alter levels of total hsf.",PMID: 9675818 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

However, in concert with Hsp40 and Hsp70, Hsp104 can reactivate proteins that have been denatured and allowed to aggregate, substrates refractory to the action of other chaperones. Hsp104 cooperates with the chaperones present in reticulocyte lysates but not with DnaK of E. coli.

Expression of a functional heterodimeric transcription factor composed of human aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (Arnt) proteins was accomplished using a single pBEVY plasmid. Previous studies suggest that inhibitory cross-talk between the estrogen receptor and the Ahr/Arnt complex may occur and that Hsp90-Ahr complex formation is important for Ahr-mediated signal transduction. Evidence for functional interaction among these proteins was investigated using pBEVY plasmids in a yeast system. No inhibitory cross-talk was observed in signaling assays performed with yeast that co-expressed Ahr, Arnt and estrogen receptor. In contrast, Ahr/Arnt-mediated signal transduction was reduced by 80% in a temperature-sensitive Hsp90 strain grown under non-permissive conditions.

Disruption of PML subnuclear domains by the acidic IE1 protein of human cytomegalovirus is mediated through interaction with PML and may modulate a RING finger-dependent cryptic transactivator function of PML.,"Ahn JH, Brignole EJ 3rd, Hayward GS.","Molecular Virology Laboratories, Departments of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA.","Both of the major immediate-early (IE) proteins IE1 and IE2 of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) as well as input viral DNA and sites of viral IE transcription colocalize with or adjacent to punctate PML domains (PML oncogenic domains [PODs] or nuclear domain 10) in the nucleus within the first few hours after infection of permissive human fibroblasts. However, colocalization of IE1 and PML in PODs is only transient, with both proteins subsequently redistributing into a nuclear diffuse form. These processes are believed to promote efficient viral IE transcription and initiation of DNA synthesis especially at low multiplicities of infection. To examine the mechanism of PML displacement by IE1, we carried out indirect immunofluorescence assay experiments with plasmids expressing intact or deleted forms of PML and IE1 in DNA-transfected cells. The results demonstrated that deletion of the C-terminal acidic region of IE1 uncouples the requirements for displacement of both endogenous and coexpressed PML from those needed to target to the PODs. Mutant PML proteins containing either a Cys point mutation within the N-terminal RING finger domain or a small deletion (of positions 281 to 304) within the coiled-coil region did not localize to the PODs but instead gave a nuclear diffuse distribution, similar to that produced by intact PML in the presence of IE1. Endogenous PML also colocalized with IE1 in metaphase chromosomes in HCMV or recombinant adenovirus type 5-IE1-infected HF cells undergoing mitosis, implying that there may be a direct physical interaction between IE1 and PML. Indeed, a specific interaction between IE1 and PML was observed in a yeast two-hybrid assay, and the strength of this interaction was comparable to that of IE2 with the retinoblastoma protein. The RING finger mutant form of PML showed a threefold-lower interaction with IE1 in the yeast system, and deletion of the N-terminal RING finger domain of PML abolished the interaction. Consistent with the IFA results, a mutant IE1 protein that lacks the C-terminal acidic region was sufficient for interaction with PML in the yeast system. The two-hybrid interaction assay also showed that both the N-terminal RING finger domain and the intact coiled-coil region of PML are required cooperatively for efficient self-interactions involving dimerization or oligomerization. Furthermore, truncated or deleted GAL4/PML fusion proteins that retained the RING finger domain but lacked the intact coiled-coil region displayed an unmasked cryptic transactivator function in both yeast and mammalian cells, and the RING finger mutation abolished this transactivation property of PML. Therefore, we suggest that a direct interaction between IE1 and the N-terminal RING finger domain of PML may inhibit oligomerization and protein-protein complex formation by PML, leading to displacement of PML and IE1 from the PODs, and that this interaction may also modulate a putative conditional transactivator function of PML.",PMID: 9671498 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

We purified a polyhistidine-tagged form of Prt1p (His-Prt1p) by Ni2+ affinity and gel filtration chromatography and obtained a complex of approximately 600 kDa composed of six polypeptides whose copurification was completely dependent on the polyhistidine tag on His-Prt1p. All five polypeptides associated with His-Prt1p were identified by mass spectrometry, and four were found to be the other putative homologs of human eIF3 subunits encoded in S. cerevisiae: YBR079c/Tif32p, Nip1p, Tif34p, and YDR429c/Tif35p. The fifth Prt1p-associated protein was eIF5, an initiation factor not previously known to interact with eIF3. The purified complex could rescue Met-tRNAiMet binding to 40S ribosomes in defective extracts from a prt1 mutant or extracts from which Nip1p had been depleted, indicating that it possesses a known biochemical activity of eIF3. These findings suggest that Tif32p, Nip1p, Prt1p, Tif34p, and Tif35p comprise an eIF3 core complex, conserved between yeast and mammals, that stably interacts with eIF5. Nip1p bound to eIF5 in yeast two-hybrid and in vitro protein binding assays. Interestingly, Sui1p also interacts with Nip1p, and both eIF5 and Sui1p have been implicated in accurate recognition of the AUG start codon. Thus, eIF5 and Sui1p may be recruited to the 40S ribosomes through physical interactions with the Nip1p subunit of eIF3.",PMID: 9671501 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

The Ssbs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are an abundant type of Hsp70 found associated with translating ribosomes. To understand better the function of Ssb in association with ribosomes, the Ssb-ribosome interaction was characterized. Incorporation of the aminoacyl-tRNA analog puromycin by translating ribosomes caused the release of Ssb concomitant with the release of nascent chains. In addition, Ssb could be cross-linked to nascent chains containing a modified lysine residue with a photoactivatable cross-linker. Together, these results suggest an interaction of Ssb with the nascent chain. The interaction of Ssb with the ribosome-nascent chain complex was stable, as demonstrated by resistance to treatment with high salt; however, Ssb interaction with the ribosome in the absence of nascent chain was salt sensitive. We propose that Ssb is a core component of the translating ribosome which interacts with both the nascent polypeptide chain and the ribosome. These interactions allow Ssb to function as a chaperone on the ribosome, preventing the misfolding of newly synthesized proteins.",PMID: 9670014 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

Subcellular fractionation and chemical cross-linking studies have revealed that Vma12p and Vma22p form a stable membrane associated complex. Cross-linking analysis also revealed a direct physical interaction between the Vma12p/Vma22p assembly complex and Vph1p, the 100-kD integral membrane subunit of the V-ATPase. The interaction of the Vma12p/Vma22p complex with Vph1p was transient (half-life of approximately 5 min), reflecting trafficking of this V-ATPase subunit through the ER en route to the vacuolar membrane. Analysis of these protein-protein interactions in ER-blocked sec12 mutant cells indicated that the Vph1p-Vma12p/Vma22p interactions are quite stable when transport of the V-ATPase out of the ER is blocked. Fractionation of solubilized membrane proteins on a density gradient revealed comigration of Vma22p and Vma12p, indicating that they form a complex even in the absence of cross-linker. Vma12p and Vma22p migrated to fractions separate from Vma21p. Loss of Vph1p caused the Vma12p/Vma22p complex to sediment to less dense fractions, consistent with association of Vma12p/ Vma22p with nascent Vph1p in ER membranes. This is the first evidence for a dedicated assembly complex in the ER required for the assembly of an integral membrane protein complex (V-ATPase) as it is transported through the secretory pathway.",PMID: 9660861 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,

Although TIF32, NIP1, and TIF35 are homologous to subunits of human eIF3, they were not known to be components of the yeast factor. We detected interactions between PRT1, TIF34, and TIF35 by the yeast two-hybrid assay and in vitro binding assays. Discrete segments (70-150 amino acids) of PRT1 and TIF35 were found to be responsible for their binding to TIF34. Temperature-sensitive mutations mapping in WD-repeat domains of TIF34 were isolated that decreased binding between TIF34 and TIF35 in vitro. The lethal effect of these mutations was suppressed by increasing TIF35 gene dosage, suggesting that the TIF34-TIF35 interaction is important for TIF34 function in translation. Pairwise in vitro interactions were also detected between PRT1 and TIF32, TIF32 and NIP1, and NIP1 and SUI1. Furthermore, PRT1, NIP1, TIF34, TIF35, and a polypeptide with the size of TIF32 were specifically coimmunoprecipitated from the ribosomal salt wash fraction.

Since these GTPases play key roles in regulating cell polarity, stress responses, and cell cycle progression, the ability of PAK to affect these processes has been examined. We previously showed that fission yeast pak1+ encodes an essential protein that affects mating and cell polarity. Here, we characterize a second pak gene (pak2+) from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Like the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins Cla4p and Skm1p, fission yeast Pak2p contains an N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain in addition to a p21-binding domain and a protein kinase domain that are common to other members of the PAK family. Unlike pak1+, pak2(+) is not essential for vegetative growth or for mating in S. pombe. Overexpression of the wild-type pak2+ allele suppresses the lethal growth defect associated with deletion of pak1+, and this suppression requires both the pleckstrin homology- and the p21-binding domains of Pak2p, as well as kinase activity. A substantial fraction of Pak2p is associated with membranous components, an association mediated both by the pleckstrin homology- and by the p21-binding domains. These results show that S. pombe encodes at least two pak genes with distinct functions and suggest that the membrane localization of Pak2p, directed by its interactions with membrane lipids and Cdc42p, is critical to its biological activity.",PMID: 9660818 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],,

The P3 nonstructural proteins harbor various activities when paired with different binding partners. These viral polypeptides regulate host cell macromolecular synthesis and function as proteinases, as RNA binding proteins, or as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. A cleavage product of the P3 region is the genome-linked protein VPg that is essential in the initiation of RNA synthesis. We have used an inducible yeast two-hybrid system to analyze directly protein-protein interactions among P3 proteins. Sixteen signals of homo- or heterodimer interactions have been observed and have been divided into three groups. Of interest is the newly discovered affinity of VPg to 3Dpol that suggests direct interaction between these molecules in genome replication. A battery of 3AB variants (eight clustered-charge-to-alanine changes and five single-amino-acid mutations) has been used to map the binding determinants of 3AB-3AB interaction which were found to differ from the amino acids critical for the 3AB-3Dpol interaction. The viral proteinase 3Cpro was not found to interact with other 3Cpro molecules or with any other P3 polypeptide in yeast cells, a result confirmed by glutaraldehyde cross-linking. The weak apparent interaction between 3AB and 3CDpro scored in the yeast two-hybrid system was in contrast to a strong signal by far-Western blotting.

Monosaccharide analysis and a-mannosidase treatment demonstrated that glycosylated rLDTI was exclusively alpha-mannosylated. A trypsin digest of reduced and S-carboxymethylated glycosylated rLDTI was separated on a reverse-phase HPLC column. Glycopeptides identified by a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry, amino acid sequence analysis, and monosaccharide analysis revealed the presence of different glycoforms. It was found that Ser24, Ser33 and Ser36 were partially glycosylated with a single mannose residue, whereas Thr42 in glycosylated rLDTI from both strains was fully occupied with manno-oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization ranging over 1-3 and 1-13 depending on the yeast strain. In phosphorylated rLDTI a single phosphate group was predominantly located at the innermost Man residue of units of mannobiose, mannotriose, mannotetraose and mannopentaose at Thr42. Oligosaccharides released by alkaline treatment were reduced by sodium borohydride and separated by high-pH anion-exchange chromatography on a CarboPac MA1 column, and analyzed by one- and two-dimensional 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Besides the major oligosaccharide Man alpha1-2Man-ol, the (for yeast protein O-glycosylation) unusual Man alpha1-3Man alpha1-2Man-ol was determined. The solution conformation of glycosylated rLDTI was investigated by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. Structure calculations by means of distance geometry showed that glycosylated rLDTI is compactly folded and contained small secondary structure elements. Analysis of the chemical shifts showed that amino acids Val32-Ser33, Ser36-Ser39 and Thr42 were affected by the O-mannosylation. In addition, changes in chemical shift were observed within the beta-hairpin peptide regions Val13-Ser16 and Gly18-Tyr21 attributed to direct interactions of the mannose residue at Ser36.

Expression of the yeast BFR2 gene is regulated at the transcriptional level and through degradation of its product.,"Chabane S, Kepes F.","Service de Biochimie et de Genetique Moleculaire, DBCM/DSV, CEA/Saclay, Gif, France.","The essential Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene BFR2 has been isolated as a high-copy suppressor of the growth defects induced by Brefeldin A, a drug that disrupts the Golgi apparatus and its protein influx. Furthermore, BFR2 has been found to display genetic interactions with four mutations affecting protein transport to the Golgi apparatus. Here we show that the level of BFR2 mRNA rapidly increased over fivefold in response to cold shock, and over threefold following nutrient replenishment by dilution of cells from exhausted to fresh minimal medium. During subsequent growth, the transcript level returned to its basal values, except for a transient drop toward the end of the exponential phase. The early burst of transcription was not caused by toxic compounds in the fresh medium, or by synchrony among cells that had simultaneously entered their first cell cycle. The BFR2 gene product (Bfr2p) was synthesized following the early burst of mRNA, and was no longer produced when the mRNA was back to basal level. Bfr2p was finally degraded after growth became limited, and reached undetectable levels in exhausted medium. Under steady-state conditions of lengthened exponential phase, the intracellular level of Bfr2p remained constant. This peculiar pattern of gene expression suggests that Bfr2p is essential for mass growth or cell proliferation, whereas it is either toxic or not required during nutrient-limited growth.",PMID: 9645427 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE],

However, their ill-defined structures, heterogeneous nature, and limited availability have prohibited the analysis of the underlying molecular mechanism. Phosphoinositolglycan-peptide (PIG-P) of defined and homogeneous structure prepared in large scale from the core glycan of a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has recently been shown to stimulate glucose transport as well as a number of glucose-metabolizing enzymes and pathways to up to 90% (at 2 to 10 microns) of the maximal insulin effect in isolated rat adipocytes, cardiomyocytes, and diaphragms (G. Muller et al., 1997, Endocrinology 138: 3459-3476). Consequently, we used this PIG-P for the present study in which we compare its intracellular signaling with that of insulin. The activation of glucose transport by both PIG-P and insulin in isolated rat adipocytes and diaphragms was found to require stimulation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase but to be independent of functional p70S6kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase. The increase in glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity in rat adipocytes in response to PIG-P and insulin was dependent on both PI 3-kinase and p70S6kinase. This suggest that the signaling pathways for PIG-P and insulin to glucose transport and metabolism converage at the level of PI 3-kinase. A component of the PIG-P signaling pathway located up-stream of PI 3-kinase was identified by desensitization of isolated rat adipocytes for PIG-P action by combined treatment with trypsin and NaCl under conditions that preserved cell viability and the insulin-mimetic activity of sodium vanadate but completely blunted the insulin response. Incubation of the cells with either trypsin or NaCl alone was ineffective. The desensitized adipocytes were reconstituted for stimulation of lipogenesis by PIG-P by addition of the concentrated trypsin/salt extract. The reconstituted adipocytes exhibited 65-75% of the maximal PIG-P response and similar EC50 values for PIG-P (2 to 5 microns) compared with control cells. A proteinaceous N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)-sensitive component contained in the trypsin/salt extract was demonstrated to bind in a functional manner to the adipocyte plasma membrane of desensitized adipocytes via bipolar interactions. An excess of trypsin/salt extract inhibited PIG-P action in untreated adipocytes in a competitive fashion compatible with a receptor function for PIG-P of this protein. The presence of the putative PIG-P receptor protein in detergent-insoluble complexes prepared from isolated rat adipocytes suggests that caveolae/detergent-insoluble complexes of the plasma membrane may play a role in insulin-mimetic signaling by PIG-P. Furthermore, treatment of isolated rat diaphragms and adipocytes with PIG-P as well as with other agents exerting partially insulin-mimetic activity, such as PI-specific phospholipase C (PLC) and the sulfonylurea glimepiride, triggered tyrosine phosphorylation of the caveolar marker protein caveolin, which was apparently correlated with stimulation of lipogenesis. Strikingly, in adipocytes subjected to combined trypsin/salt treatment, PIG-P, PI-specific PLC, and glimepiride failed completely to provoke insulin-mimetic effects. A working model is presented for a signaling pathway in insulin-sensitive cells used by PIG(-P) molecules which involves GPI structures, the trypsin/salt- and NEM-sensitive receptor protein for PIG-P, and additional proteins located in caveolae/detergent-insoluble complexes.",PMID: 9642681 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

We demonstrate that a rad52 mutation is epistatic to the rfa1-44 mutation, placing RFA1 and RAD52 in the same genetic pathway. Furthermore, two-hybrid analysis indicates the existence of interactions between Rad52 and all three subunits of RPA. The nature of this Rad52-RPA interaction was further explored by using two different mutant alleles of rad52.

TBP interacts with both UAF and CF in vitro. In addition, a subunit of UAF, Rrn9p, interacts with TBP in vitro and in the two-hybrid system, suggesting the possible importance of this interaction for UAF function. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified three mutations in RRN9 that abolish the interaction of Rrn9p with TBP without affecting its interaction with Rrn10p, another subunit of UAF. Yeast cells containing any one of these individual mutations, L110S, L269P, or L274Q, did not show any growth defects. However, cells containing a combination of L110S with one of the other two mutations showed a temperature-sensitive phenotype, and this phenotype was suppressed by fusing the mutant genes to SPT15, which encodes TBP. In addition, another mutation (F186S), which disrupts both Rrn9p-TBP and Rrn9p-Rrn10p interactions in the two-hybrid system, abolished UAF function in vivo, and this mutational defect was suppressed by fusion of the mutant gene to SPT15 combined with overexpression of Rrn10p. These experiments demonstrate that the interaction of UAF with TBP, which is presumably achieved by the interaction of Rrn9p with TBP, is indeed important for high-level transcription of rDNA by RNA polymerase I in vivo.",PMID: 9632758 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

The actin cytoskeleton is required for this process, potentially as a track to direct mitochondrial movement into the bud. Sedimentation assays reveal two different components required for mitochondria-actin interactions: (1) mitochondrial actin binding protein(s) (mABP), a peripheral mitochondrial outer membrane protein(s) with ATP-sensitive actin binding activity, and (2) a salt-inextractable, presumably integral, membrane protein(s) required for docking of mABP on the organelle. mABP activity is abolished by treatment of mitochondria with high salt. Addition of either the salt-extracted mitochondrial peripheral membrane proteins (SE), or a protein fraction with ATP-sensitive actin-binding activity isolated from SE, to salt-washed mitochondria restores this activity. mABP docking activity is saturable, resistant to high salt, and inhibited by pre-treatment of salt-washed mitochondria with papain.

Mitochondria isolated from an mmm1-1 temperature-sensitive mutant or from an mdm10 deletion mutant show no mABP activity and no mABP docking activity. Consistent with this, mitochondrial motility in vivo in mmm1-1 and mdm10Delta mutants appears to be actin independent. Depolymerization of F-actin using latrunculin-A results in loss of long-distance, linear movement and a fivefold decrease in the velocity of mitochondrial movement. Mitochondrial motility in mmm1-1 and mdm10Delta mutants is indistinguishable from that in latrunculin-A-treated wild-type cells. We propose that Mmm1p and Mdm10p are required for docking of mABP on the surface of yeast mitochondria and coupling the organelle to the actin cytoskeleton.",PMID: 9628893 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]

In the present study we characterize the effect of mutations in genes of the 'error-prone' or postreplicative repair group on recombination and mutation. We show that rad5 and rad18 strains have elevated levels of spontaneous recombination, both of ectopic gene conversion and of recombination between direct repeats. The increase in recombination levels is similar in both mutants and in the rad5 rad18 double mutant, suggesting that the RAD5 and RAD18 gene products act together with respect to spontaneous recombination. In contrast, RAD5 and RAD18 play alternative roles in mutagenic repair: mutations in each of these genes elevate spontaneous forward mutation at the CAN1 locus, but when both genes are deleted, a low level of spontaneous mutagenesis is seen. The RAD5/RAD18 pathway of mutagenic repair is dependent on the REV3-encoded translesion polymerase. We analyze the interactions between the RAD5 and RAD18 gene products and other repair genes. The high recombination levels seen in rad5 and rad18 mutants is dependent on the RAD1, RAD51, RAD52, and RAD57 genes.

The amino-terminal domain of 284-residue TMs is among the most conserved and functionally important regions. The first nine residues are proposed to bind to the carboxyl-terminal nine residues to form the ""overlap"" region between successive TMs, which bind along the actin filament. Here, the structure of the N-terminus of muscle alpha-TM, in a chimeric peptide, TMZip, has been solved using circular dichroism (CD) and two-dimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance (2D 1H NMR) spectroscopy. Residues 1-14 of TMZip are the first 14 N-terminal residues of rabbit striated alpha-TM, and residues 15-32 of TMZip are the last 18 C-terminal residues of the yeast GCN4 transcription factor. CD measurements show that TMZip forms a two-stranded coiled-coil alpha-helix with an enthalpy of folding of -34 +/- 2 kcal/mol. In 2D1H NMR studies at 15 degrees C, pH 6.4, the peptide exhibits 123 sequential and medium range intrachain NOE cross peaks per chain, characteristic of alpha-helices extending from residue 1 to residue 29, together with 85 long-range NOE cross peaks arising from interchain interactions. The three-dimensional structure of TMZip has been determined using these data plus an additional 509 intrachain constraints per chain. The coiled-coil domain extends to the N-terminus. Amide hydrogen exchange studies, however, suggest that the TM region is less stable than the GCN4 region. The work reported here is the first atomic-resolution structure of any region of TM and it allows insight into the mechanism of the function of the highly conserved N-terminal domain."

We have addressed the role of the beta subunit (Sec61beta) during cotranslational protein translocation. With a reconstituted system, we show that a Sec61 complex lacking Sec61beta is essentially inactive when elongation and membrane targeting of a nascent chain occur at the same time. The translocation process is perturbed at a step where the nascent chain would be inserted into the translocation channel. However, if sufficient time is given for the interaction of the nascent polypeptide with the mutant Sec61 complex, translocation is almost normal. Thus Sec61beta kinetically facilitates cotranslational translocation, but is not essential for it. Using chemical cross-linking we show that Sec61beta not only interacts with subunits of the Sec61 complex but also with the 25-kD subunit of the signal peptidase complex (SPC25), thus demonstrating for the first time a tight interaction between the SPC and the Sec61 complex. Interestingly, the cross-links between Sec61beta and SPC25 and between Sec61beta and Sec61alpha depend on the presence of membrane-bound ribosomes, suggesting that these interactions are induced when translocation is initiated. We propose that the SPC is transiently recruited to the translocation site, thus enhancing its activity."

The amino-terminal 84 amino acids of TOM22 extend into the cytosol and include 19 negatively and 6 positively charged residues. This region of the protein is thought to interact with positively charged presequences on mitochondrial preproteins, presumably via electrostatic interactions. We constructed a series of mutant derivatives of TOM22 in which 2 to 15 of the negatively charged residues in the cytosolic domain were changed to their corresponding amido forms. The mutant constructs were transformed into a sheltered Neurospora crassa heterokaryon bearing a tom22::hygromycin R disruption in one nucleus. All constructs restored viability to the disruption-carrying nucleus and gave rise to homokaryotic strains containing mutant tom22 alleles. Isolated mitochondria from three representative mutant strains, including the mutant carrying 15 neutralized residues (strain 861), imported precursor proteins at efficiencies comparable to those for wild-type organelles. Precursor binding studies with mitochondrial outer membrane vesicles from several of the mutant strains, including strain 861, revealed only slight differences from binding to wild-type vesicles. Deletion mutants lacking portions of the negatively charged region of TOM22 can also restore viability to the disruption-containing nucleus, but mutants lacking the entire region cannot. Taken together, these data suggest that an abundance of negative charges in the cytosolic domain of TOM22 is not essential for the binding or import of mitochondrial precursor proteins; however, other features in the domain are required."

Here, we have established yeast strains in which an autoactivated Jak2 kinase induces tyrosine phosphorylation, dimerization, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding of a concomitantly expressed Stat5 protein. Transcriptional activity of Stat5 on a stably integrated, Stat-dependent reporter gene required the C-terminal fusion of the VP16 transactivation domain. In such yeast strains, the interaction between Jak2 and Stat5 was analyzed without interference by other mammalian proteins involved in regulating Jak-Stat signaling, and mutant versions of both proteins were analyzed for their ability to productively interact. Complexes between Jak2 and Stat5 were found to be stable under stringent co-immunoprecipitation conditions. Deletion of the Jak homology regions 2-7 (JH2-JH7) of Jak2, leaving only the kinase domain (JH1) intact, reduced the ability of the kinase to phosphorylate Stat5, whereas deletion of the JH2 domain caused an increased enzymatic activity. A site-directed R618K mutation in the Stat5 SH2 domain abolished the phosphorylation by Jak2, while deletion of the C terminus led to Stat5 hyperphosphorylation. A single phosphotyrosine-SH2 domain interaction was sufficient for the dimerization of Stat5, but such dimers bound to DNA very inefficiently. Together, our data show that yeast cells are appropriate tools for studying Jak-Stat or Stat-Stat interactions. Our mutational analysis suggests that the Stat5 SH2 domain is essential for the interaction with Jak2 and that the kinase domain of Jak2 is sufficient for Jak2-Stat5 interaction. Therefore, the Jak kinase domain may be all that is needed to cause Stat phosphorylation in situations where receptor docking is dispensable."

Confirming the specificity of candidate clones requires separation and isolation of yeast plasmids, propagation in bacteria and testing combinations of DNA-binding and activation domain hybrids in yeast. In order to simplify this procedure, we developed a rapid method based on PCR amplification of library insert DNAs and in vivo cloning into the activation domain hybrid vector. Reporter gene activity is assayed in parallel for combinations with different DNA-binding domain hybrids. Further characterization of inserts does not require plasmid isolation and intermediate hosts."

H.Herrmann@DKFZ-Heidelberg.de","Intermediate filaments are built from one to several members of a multigene family encoding fibrous proteins that share a highly conserved hierarchic assembly plan for the formation of multistranded filaments from distinctly structured extended coiled coils. Despite the rather low primary sequence identity, intermediate filaments form apparently similar filaments with regard to their spatial dimensions and physical properties. Over the past few years, substantial progress has been made in the elucidation of the complex expression patterns and clinically relevant phenotypes of intermediate filaments. The key question of how these filaments assemble and what the molecular architecture of their distinct assembly intermediates comprises, however, has still not been answered to the extent that has been achieved for microfilaments and microtubules."
